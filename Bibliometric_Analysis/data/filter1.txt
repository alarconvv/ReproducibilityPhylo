J	Milkowski, M; Hensel, WM; Hohol, M				Milkowski, Marcin; Hensel, Witold M.; Hohol, Mateusz			Replicability or reproducibility? On the replication crisis in computational neuroscience and sharing only relevant detail	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Replication studies; Computational modeling; Methodology of computational neuroscience; Direct and conceptual replication; Replication and reproduction	CA2+ OSCILLATIONS; MODELS; LANGUAGE	Replicability and reproducibility of computational models has been somewhat understudied by the replication movement. In this paper, we draw on methodological studies into the replicability of psychological experiments and on the mechanistic account of explanation to analyze the functions of model replications and model reproductions in computational neuroscience. We contend that model replicability, or independent researchers' ability to obtain the same output using original code and data, and model reproducibility, or independent researchers' ability to recreate a model without original code, serve different functions and fail for different reasons. This means that measures designed to improve model replicability may not enhance (and, in some cases, may actually damage) model reproducibility. We claim that although both are undesirable, low model reproducibility poses more of a threat to long-term scientific progress than low model replicability. In our opinion, low model reproducibility stems mostly from authors' omitting to provide crucial information in scientific papers and we stress that sharing all computer code and data is not a solution. Reports of computational studies should remain selective and include all and only relevant bits of code.

J	Ostermann, FO; Granell, C				Ostermann, Frank O.; Granell, Carlos			Advancing Science with VGI: Reproducibility and Replicability of Recent Studies using VGI	TRANSACTIONS IN GIS			English	Article							INFORMATION	In scientific research, reproducibility and replicability are requirements to ensure the advancement of our body of knowledge. This holds true also for VGI-related research and studies. However, the characteristics of VGI suggest particular difficulties in ensuring reproducibility and replicability. In this article, we aim to examine the current situation in VGI-related research, and identify strategies to ensure realization of its full potential. To do so, we first investigate the different aspects of reproducibility and replicability and their impact on VGI-related research. These impacts are different depending on the objectives of the study. Therefore, we examine the study focus of VGI-related research to assess the current body of research and structure our assessment. This work is based on a rigorous review of the elements of reproducibility and a systematic mapping and analysis of 58 papers on the use of VGI in the crisis management field. Results of our investigation show that reproducibility issues related to data are a serious concern, while reproducibility issues related to analysis methods and processes face fewer challenges. However, since most studies still focus on analyzing the source data, reproducibility and replicability are still an unsolved problem in VGI-related research. Therefore, we show initiatives tackling the problem, and finally formulate strategies to improve the situation.

J	Sui, D; Kedron, P				Sui, Daniel; Kedron, Peter			Reproducibility and Replicability in the Context of the Contested Identities of Geography	ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF GEOGRAPHERS			English	Article						betweenness; GIScience; idiographic; nomothetic; replicability; reproducibility	EXCEPTIONALISM	This article situates the current discussion of reproducibility and replicability taking place across the sciences within geographers' enduring discussion of nomothetic and idiographic approaches, best exemplified by the Hartshorne-Schaefer debate. Although the Hartshorne-Schaefer debate retrospectively set the stage for the development of geography from the 1950s to the present, it is surprising that direct discussions of reproducibility and replicability remain mostly absent from the geographic literature. Drawing from recent literature on reproducibility and replicability in the humanities and physical, social, and computational sciences, it is argued that a deeper focus on these issues will have varied impacts on the discipline. Adopting and improving reproducible practices in geographic research reliant on scientific methods will align geographic research with mainstream scientific inquiry. The discipline's ever-growing diversity of theoretical perspectives and problem domains also makes it likely that a significant portion of geographic research, like many other fields in science, might not be affected by the issues and concerns of reproducibility and replicability. Moving forward, geographic research might continue to benefit from a pluralist framework that embraces both the nomothetic and idiographic approaches, particularly in a broader research environment increasingly defined by disciplinary synthesis and convergence.

Enhancing Reproducibility and Replicability in Remote Sensing Deep Learning Research and Practice	REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						deep learning; replicability; reproducibility; semantic segmentation; object detection	CLASSIFICATION	Many issues can reduce the reproducibility and replicability of deep learning (DL) research and application in remote sensing, including the complexity and customizability of architectures, variable model training and assessment processes and practice, inability to fully control random components of the modeling workflow, data leakage, computational demands, and the inherent nature of the process, which is complex, difficult to perform systematically, and challenging to fully document. This communication discusses key issues associated with convolutional neural network (CNN)-based DL in remote sensing for undertaking semantic segmentation, object detection, and instance segmentation tasks and offers suggestions for best practices for enhancing reproducibility and replicability and the subsequent utility of research results, proposed workflows, and generated data. We also highlight lingering issues and challenges facing researchers as they attempt to improve the reproducibility and replicability of their experiments.

Today's form of communicating scientific results with written articles is the foundation we build our work on. The reproducibility and replicability of the experiments and observations are central to this process of validation. However, reproducibility and replicability are not always guaranteed, sometimes referred to as "crisis of reproducibility." We believe that remote sensing, in general, suffers from this crisis. To analyze the extent of the crisis, we conducted a survey on the state of reproducibility in remote sensing. Based on this survey, we map the problem of reproducibility with a focus on synthetic aperture radar remote sensing, as this is our area of research. We also give advice on how to improve reproducibility in remote sensing.

J	Epskamp, S				Epskamp, Sacha			Reproducibility and Replicability in a Fast-Paced Methodological World	ADVANCES IN METHODS AND PRACTICES IN PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCE			English	Article						replication; reproducibility; software; open data; open materials	PSYCHOLOGY	Methodological developments and software implementations are progressing at an increasingly fast pace. The introduction and widespread acceptance of preprint archived reports and open-source software have made state-of-the-art statistical methods readily accessible to researchers. At the same time, researchers are increasingly concerned that their results should be reproducible (i.e., the same analysis should yield the same numeric results at a later time), which is a basic requirement for assessing the results' replicability (i.e., whether results at a later time support the same conclusions). Although this age of fast-paced methodology greatly facilitates reproducibility and replicability, it also undermines them in ways not often realized by researchers. This article draws researchers' attention to these threats and proposes guidelines to help minimize their impact. Reproducibility may be influenced by software development and change over time, a problem that is greatly compounded by the rising dependency between software packages. Replicability is affected by rapidly changing standards, researcher degrees of freedom, and possible bugs or errors in code, whether introduced by software developers or empirical researchers implementing an analysis. This article concludes with a list of recommendations to improve the reproducibility and replicability of results.

However, recent findings in some disciplines suggest that many studies fail to reach this standard, moving issues surrounding reproducibility and replicability forward into the research agenda of those fields. While the topic has yet to become a point of controversy in geography, the intricacies of geographic phenomena and spatial data analysis make the field vulnerable to criticism. This commentary discusses how uncertainties related to the conception, measurement, analysis, and communication of geographic analyses contribute to difficulties in the reproduction and replication of geographic research. Investigating how these uncertainties collectively impact the reproducibility and replicability of spatial data analyses should be a critical focus of future Geographical Analysis research. A call to action for geographers to improve the reproducibility and replicability of their work and specific recommendations on how Geographical Analysis might facilitate this process conclude the commentary.

Little is known about how to operationally define R-fMRI reproducibility and to what extent it is affected by multiple comparison correction strategies and sample size. We comprehensively assessed two aspects of reproducibility, test-retest reliability and replicability, on widely used R-fMRI metrics in both between-subject contrasts of sex differences and within-subject comparisons of eyes-open and eyes-closed (EOEC) conditions. We noted permutation test with Threshold-Free Cluster Enhancement (TFCE), a strict multiple comparison correction strategy, reached the best balance between family-wise error rate (under 5%) and test-retest reliability/replicability (e.g., 0.68 for test-retest reliability and 0.25 for replicability of amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) for between-subject sex differences, 0.49 for replicability of ALFF for within-subject EOEC differences). Although R-fMRI indices attained moderate reliabilities, they replicated poorly in distinct datasets (replicability<0.3 for between-subject sex differences,<0.5 for within-subject EOEC differences). By randomly drawing different sample sizes from a single site, we found reliability, sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) rose as sample size increased. Small sample sizes (e.g.,<80 [40 per group]) not only minimized power (sensitivity<2%), but also decreased the likelihood that significant results reflect true effects (PPV<0.26) in sex differences. Our findings have implications for how to select multiple comparison correction strategies and highlight the importance of sufficiently large sample sizes in R-fMRI studies to enhance reproducibility.

J	Liu, C; Gao, CY; Xia, X; Lo, D; Grundy, J; Yang, XH				Liu, Chao; Gao, Cuiyun; Xia, Xin; Lo, David; Grundy, John; Yang, Xiaohu			On the Reproducibility and Replicability of Deep Learning in Software Engineering	ACM TRANSACTIONS ON SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND METHODOLOGY			English	Article						Deep learning; replicability; reproducibility; software engineering	NEURAL-NETWORKS; REPLICATION	Context: Deep learning (DL) techniques have gained significant popularity among software engineering (SE) researchers in recent years. This is because they can often solve many SE challenges without enormous manual feature engineering effort and complex domain knowledge. Objective: Although many DL studies have reported substantial advantages over other state-of-the-art models on effectiveness, they often ignore two factors: (1) reproducibility-whether the reported experimental results can be obtained by other researchers using authors' artifacts (i.e., source code and datasets) with the same experimental setup; and (2) replicability-whether the reported experimental result can be obtained by other researchers using their re-implemented artifacts with a different experimental setup. We observed that DL studies commonly overlook these two factors and declare them as minor threats or leave them for future work. This is mainly due to high model complexity with many manually set parameters and the timeconsuming optimization process, unlike classical supervised machine learning (ML) methods (e.g., random forest). This study aims to investigate the urgency and importance of reproducibility and replicability for DL studies on SE tasks. Method: In this study, we conducted a literature review on 147 DL studies recently published in 20 SE venues and 20 AI (Artificial Intelligence) venues to investigate these issues. We also re-ran four representative DL models in SE to investigate important factors that may strongly affect the reproducibility and replicability of a study. Results: Our statistics show the urgency of investigating these two factors in SE, where only 10.2% of the studies investigate any research question to show that their models can address at least one issue of replicability and/or reproducibility. More than 62.6% of the studies do not even share high-quality source code or complete data to support the reproducibility of their complex models. Meanwhile, our experimental results showthe importance of reproducibility and replicability, where the reported performance of a DL model could not be reproduced for an unstable optimization process. Replicability could be substantially compromised if the model training is not convergent, or if performance is sensitive to the size of vocabulary and testing data. Conclusion: It is urgent for the SE community to provide a long-lasting link to a high-quality reproduction package, enhanceDL-based solution stability and convergence, and avoid performance sensitivity on different sampled data.

Reproducibility and replicability of high-frequency, in-home digital biomarkers in reducing sample sizes for clinical trials	ALZHEIMERS & DEMENTIA-TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH & CLINICAL INTERVENTIONS			English	Article						early prevention; linear mixed-effect models; mild cognitive impairment; randomized controlled trials; technology assessment	DAILY COMPUTER USE; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; DRUG DEVELOPMENT	Introduction Reproducibility and replicability of results are rarely achieved for digital biomarkers analyses. We reproduced and replicated previously reported sample size estimates based on digital biomarker and neuropsychological test outcomes in a hypothetical 4-year early-phase Alzheimer's disease trial. Methods Original data and newly collected data (using a different motion sensor) came from the Oregon Center for Aging & Technology (ORCATECH). Given trajectories of those with incident mild cognitive impairment and normal cognition would represent trajectories of the control and experimental groups in a hypothetical trial, sample sizes to provide 80% power to detect effect sizes ranging from 20% to 50% were calculated. Results For the reproducibility, identical P-values and slope estimates were found with both digital biomarkers and neuropsychological test measures between the previous and current studies. As for the replicability, a greater correlation was found between original and replicated sample size estimates for digital biomarkers (r = 0.87, P < .001) than neuropsychological test outcomes (r = 0.75, P < .001). Discussion Reproducibility and replicability of digital biomarker analyses are feasible and encouraged to establish the reliability of findings.

Replicability was defined as computational replicability, determined by comparing two analyses of the same high-resolution MRI data set performed with identical analysis software and computer hardware. Repeatability was determined by comparing the analyses of two MRI scans of the same participant taken during two independent MRI sessions on the same day for the Kirby-21 study. Long-term reproducibility was assessed by analyzing two MRI scans of the same participant in the longitudinal OASIS-2 study. We determined percent difference, the image intraclass correlation coefficient, the coefficient of variation, and the intraclass correlation coefficient between two analyses. Our results show that CERES and ACAPULCO use stochastic algorithms that result in surprisingly high differences between identical analyses for ACAPULCO and small differences for CERES. Changes between two consecutive scans from the Kirby-21 study were less than +/- 5% in most cases for FreeSurfer and CERES (i.e., demonstrating high repeatability). As expected, long-term reproducibility was lower than repeatability for all software tools. In summary, CERES is an accurate, as demonstrated before, and reproducible tool for fully automated segmentation and parcellation of the cerebellum. We conclude with recommendations for the assessment of replicability, repeatability, and long-term reproducibility in future studies on cerebellar structure.

This process is called "replicability" when using the original authors' artifacts (e.g., code), or "reproducibility" otherwise (e.g., re-implementing algorithms). Reproducibility and replicability of research results have gained a lot of interest recently with assessment studies being led in various fields, and they are often seen as a trigger for better result diffusion and transparency. In this work, we assess replicability in Computer Graphics, by evaluating whether the code is available and whether it works properly. As a proxy for this field we compiled, ran and analyzed 151 codes out of 374 papers from 2014, 2016 and 2018 SIGGRAPH conferences. This analysis shows a clear increase in the number of papers with available and operational research codes with a dependency on the subfields, and indicates a correlation between code replicability and citation count. We further provide an interactive tool to explore our results and evaluation data.

"The ASA president's task force statement on statistical significance and replicability" has provided a solid basis for resolving the quarrel, but although the significance part is clearly dealt with, the replicability part raises further discussions. Given the clear statement regarding significance, in this article, we consider the validity of p-value use for statistical inference as de facto. We briefly review the bibliography regarding the relevant controversy in recent years and illustrate how already proposed approaches, or slight adaptations thereof, can be readily implemented to address both significance and reproducibility, adding credibility to empirical study findings. The definitions used for the notions of replicability and reproducibility are also clearly described. We argue that any p-value must be reported along with its corresponding s-value followed by (1-a)% confidence intervals and the rejection replication index.

J	Repar, A; Martinc, M; Pollak, S				Repar, Andraz; Martinc, Matej; Pollak, Senja			Reproduction, replication, analysis and adaptation of a term alignment approach	LANGUAGE RESOURCES AND EVALUATION			English	Article						Bilingual term alignment; Reproducibility; Machine learning; Cognates		In this paper, we look at the issue of reproducibility and replicability in bilingual terminology alignment (BTA). We propose a set of best practices for reproducibility and replicability of NLP papers and analyze several influential BTA papers from this perspective. Next, we present our attempts at replication and reproduction, where we focus on a bilingual terminology alignment approach described by Aker et al. (Extracting bilingual terminologies from comparable corpora. In: Proceedings of the 51st annual meeting of the association for computational linguistics, vol. 1 402-411,2013) who treat bilingual term alignment as a binary classification problem and train an SVM classifier on various dictionary and cognate-based features. Despite closely following the original paper with only minor deviations-in areas where the original description is not clear enough-we obtained significantly worse results than the authors of the original paper. We then analyze the reasons for the discrepancy and describe our attempts at adaptation of the approach to improve the results. Only after several adaptations, we achieve results which are close to the results published in the original paper. Finally, we perform the experiments to verify the replicability and reproducibility of our own code. We publish our code and datasets online to assure the reproducibility of the results of our experiments and implement the selected BTA models in an online platform making them easily reusable even by the technically less-skilled researchers.

Conducting Replication Studies With Confidence	JOURNAL OF NURSING EDUCATION			English	Article							STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE; EDUCATION RESEARCH; CRISIS	Although essential to the development of a robust evidence base for nurse educators, the concepts of replication and reproducibility have received little attention in the nursing education literature. In this Methodology Corner installment, the concepts of study replication and reproducibility are explored in depth. In designing, conducting, and documenting the findings of studies in nursing education, researchers are encouraged to make design choices that improve study replicability and reproducibility of study findings.

On translational caution and premature applications of attachment theory	ATTACHMENT & HUMAN DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Attachment; replication; translational crisis; policy; ethics; crying; Lakatosian research program	LEARNING-THEORY; INFANT; METAANALYSIS	In the biomedical, behavioral and neurobiological sciences reproducibility and replicability of research results have become a major issue. The question is whether attachment research is also plagued by lack of replicability, and if so whether one can speak of a crisis? Furthermore, discussions about the applicability of attachment research findings to policy and (clinical) practice have recently been intensified. The subsequent question arises whether one could even speak of a "translational crisis". In this paper assumptions and conditions of replicability and applicability will be outlined. Some examples of attachment findings lost or found in translation to policy and practice (e.g. on infant crying and parental insensitive responsiveness) will be used to illustrate the challenges and chances of bridging the gap between attachment science and practice.

In computing, it is imperative to reuse computer code to continue development on specific projects. Reproducibility is a fundamental building block in science, and experimental reproducibility issues have recently been of great concern. It may be surprising that reproducibility is also of concern in computational science. In this study, we used a previously published code to investigate neural network activity and we were unable to replicate our original results. This led us to investigate the code in question, and we found that several different aspects, attributable to floating-point arithmetic, were the cause of these replicability issues. Furthermore, we uncovered other manifestations of this lack of replicability in other parts of the computation with this model. The simulated model is a standard system of ordinary differential equations, very much like those commonly used in computational neuroscience. Thus, we believe that other researchers in the field should be vigilant when using such models and avoid drawing conclusions from calculations if their qualitative results can be substantially modified through non-reproducible circumstances.

Reproducibility: A Researcher-Centered Definition	MULTIMODAL TECHNOLOGIES AND INTERACTION			English	Article						reproducibility; definition; replicability; open science; researcher-centered; user-centered; bottom-up		Recent years have introduced major shifts in scientific reporting and publishing. The scientific community, publishers, funding agencies, and the public expect research to adhere to principles of openness, reproducibility, replicability, and repeatability. However, studies have shown that scientists often have neither the right tools nor suitable support at their disposal to meet these modern science challenges. In fact, even the concrete expectations connected to these terms may be unclear and subject to field-specific, organizational, and personal interpretations. Based on a narrative literature review of work that defines characteristics of open science, reproducibility, replicability, and repeatability, as well as a review of recent work on researcher-centered requirements, we find that the bottom-up practices and needs of researchers contrast top-down expectations encoded in terms related to reproducibility and open science. We identify and define reproducibility as a central term that concerns the ease of access to scientific resources, as well as their completeness, to the degree required for efficiently and effectively interacting with scientific work. We hope that this characterization helps to create a mutual understanding across science stakeholders, in turn paving the way for suitable and stimulating environments, fit to address the challenges of modern science reporting and publishing.

J	Finocchi, R; Perri, A				Finocchi, Riccardo; Perri, Antonio			Minting, replication, value	RIVISTA ITALIANA DI FILOSOFIA DEL LINGUAGGIO			Italian	Article						Replicability; Coinage; Linguistic value; Type/Token; Money		The concept of replicability has always crossed the basic relationships between discourses, money, rites established by philosophy and humanities. In this paper a critique of the idea of coinage (and the concept of token) is developed, grounding on a philosophical rather than philological approach. We argue about the fundamental role played by a positive definition of money value, which is indeed also the core of any social praxis institutionally constituted through replicability. The "double essence" of value in Saussure is so reconstructed as to make it a sort of paradigm of any social ontology and practice of technical reproducibility. In any case, the growing invasion of digital reproducibility is deemed to weaken 'the same' (the replica): it will become more and more 'identical', indistinguishable (as in the coinage), therefore reducing replicas to mere relative and negative values. The 'identical' without value, then, eclipses any potential of meaning.

Material and Methods: Thirty patients with partially edentulous posterior maxilla were selected and submitted to bilateral sinus lift using the lateral window approach technique, with grafting materials selected and submitted to cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans, both pre- and postoperatively. Then, datasets were uploaded to therapeutic digital planning software to measure the volume of the right and left maxillary sinuses and the nasal and maxillary sinus airway complex. Gage R & R statistical analysis was performed to assess the replicability and reproducibility of the digital measurement technique. Results: The variability attributable to the novel digital measurement technique was 3.4% for replicability and 3.4% for reproducibility of the total variability of the samples. Conclusion: The novel digital method proposed is a replicable and reproducible technique for analyzing the volume of the right and left maxillary sinuses and the nasal and maxillary sinus airway complex after a sinus lift using the lateral window approach technique, allowing an accurate pre-operative assessment of maxillary sinus lift surgery, avoiding complications and making surgery more predictable.

We discuss three concrete definitions of replicability based on: (1) whether published findings about the signs of effects are mostly correct, (2) how effective replication studies are in reproducing whatever true effect size was present in the original experiment and (3) whether true effect sizes tend to diminish in replication. We apply techniques from multiple testing and postselection inference to develop new methods that answer these questions while explicitly accounting for selection bias. Our analyses suggest that the RP:P dataset is largely consistent with publication bias due to selection of significant effects. The methods in this paper make no distributional assumptions about the true effect sizes.

We replicate 21 systematically selected experimental studies in the social sciences published in Nature and Science between 2010 and 201516-36. The replications follow analysis plans reviewed by the original authors and pre-registered prior to the replications. The replications are high powered, with sample sizes on average about five times higher than in the original studies. We find a significant effect in the same direction as the original study for 13 (62%) studies, and the effect size of the replications is on average about 50% of the original effect size. Replicability varies between 12 (57%) and 14 (67%) studies for complementary replicability indicators. Consistent with these results, the estimated truepositive rate is 67% in a Bayesian analysis. The relative effect size of true positives is estimated to be 71%, suggesting that both false positives and inflated effect sizes of true positives contribute to imperfect reproducibility. Furthermore, we find that peer beliefs of replicability are strongly related to replicability, suggesting that the research community could predict which results would replicate and that failures to replicate were not the result of chance alone.

The performance of standardized patients in portraying clinical scenarios in speech-language therapy	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE & COMMUNICATION DISORDERS			English	Article						speech and language therapy; clinical supervision; education	COMMUNICATION-SKILLS; PATIENTS ACCURACY; SIMULATION; EDUCATION	BackgroundStandardized patients (SPs) are frequently included in the clinical preparation of students in the health sciences. An acknowledged benefit of using SPs is the opportunity to provide a standardized method by which students can demonstrate and develop their competency. Relatively little is known, however, about the capacity of SPs to offer an accurate and standardized performance across a speech-language therapy student cohort. AimsTo investigate the accuracy, reproducibility (consistent performance of each SP across student interviews) and replicability (consistent performance of a number of SPs across each scenario) of SPs portraying three scenarios, each as a parent of a child presenting with a speech disorder. Methods & ProceduresForty-four speech-language therapy students interviewed four SPs to gain a case history. All interviews were videotaped. The accuracy of SP portrayal of key features of each scenario was scored by an expert rater and two other raters. Data were analysed to determine levels of accuracy, reproducibility and replicability, and inter-rater reliability was evaluated. Outcomes & ResultsSPs were found to have moderate to high levels of accuracy across the three scenarios. There were no significant differences in the performances of each individual SP across interviews or between all SPs on each scenario, indicating that reproducibility and replicability were achieved. Overall inter-rater reliability between raters across all scenarios was greater than 80%. Conclusions & ImplicationsThe results would seem to indicate that SPs can present in a standardized manner within a speech-language therapy context, confirming the value of their inclusion in clinical education programmes. Suggestions for improving the training of SPs in order to maintain accuracy are highlighted.

Recently Nguyen, Strazdins, Nicholson and Cooklin (NSNC; 2018) evaluated the impact of complete case analysis and multiple imputation in studies of parental employment and health. Their work joins interdisciplinary efforts to educate and motivate scientists across the research community to use principled statistical methods when analyzing incomplete data. Although we fully support and encourage work in parallel to NSNC's, we also think that further actions should be taken by the research community to improve current practices. In this commentary, we discuss some aspects and misconceptions related to analysis of incomplete data, in particular multiple imputation. In our view, the missing data problem is part of a larger problem of research reproducibility and replicability today. Thus, we believe that improving analysis and reporting of incomplete data will make reproducibility and replicability efforts easier. We also provide a brief checklist of recommendations which could be used by members of the scientific community, including practitioners, journal editors, and reviewers to set higher publication standards.

The REPRISE project: protocol for an evaluation of REProducibility and Replicability In Syntheses of Evidence	SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS			English	Article						Reproducibility of Results; Replication; Transparency; Systematic reviews; Meta-analysis; Methodology; Quality	SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS; REPLICATION RESEARCH; BARRIERS; METAANALYSES; AGREEMENT; SEARCH; SET	Background: Investigations of transparency, reproducibility and replicability in science have been directed largely at individual studies. It is just as critical to explore these issues in syntheses of studies, such as systematic reviews, given their influence on decision-making and future research. We aim to explore various aspects relating to the transparency, reproducibility and replicability of several components of systematic reviews with meta-analysis of the effects of health, social, behavioural and educational interventions. Methods: The REPRISE (REProducibility and Replicability In Syntheses of Evidence) project consists of four studies. We will evaluate the completeness of reporting and sharing of review data, analytic code and other materials in a random sample of 300 systematic reviews of interventions published in 2020 (Study 1). We will survey authors of systematic reviews to explore their views on sharing review data, analytic code and other materials and their understanding of and opinions about replication of systematic reviews (Study 2). We will then evaluate the extent of variation in results when we (a) independently reproduce meta-analyses using the same computational steps and analytic code (if available) as used in the original review (Study 3), and (b) crowdsource teams of systematic reviewers to independently replicate a subset of methods (searches for studies, selection of studies for inclusion, collection of outcome data, and synthesis of results) in a sample of the original reviews; 30 reviews will be replicated by 1 team each and 2 reviews will be replicated by 15 teams (Study 4). Discussion: The REPRISE project takes a systematic approach to determine how reliable systematic reviews of interventions are. We anticipate that results of the REPRISE project will inform strategies to improve the conduct and reporting of future systematic reviews.

A Call for Open Science in Giftedness Research	GIFTED CHILD QUARTERLY			English	Article						preregistration; replication; reproducibility; replication crisis; p-hacking; questionable research practices (QRPs); HARKing; open science; open data; open materials; registered report	PSYCHOLOGICAL-SCIENCE; REGISTERED REPORTS; PUBLICATION BIAS; FILE DRAWER; REPLICATION; CITATIONS	Current practices in study design and data analysis have led to low reproducibility and replicability of findings in fields such as psychology, medicine, biology, and economics. Because gifted education research relies on the same underlying statistical and sociological paradigms, it is likely that it too suffers from these problems. This article discusses the origin of the poor replicability and introduces a set of open science practices that can increase the rigor and trustworthiness of gifted education's scientific findings: preregistration, open data and open materials, registered reports, and preprints. Readers are directed to Internet resources for facilitating open science. To model these practices, a pre peer-review preprint of this article is available at https://psyarxiv.com/nhuv3/.

This includes eight total experiments replicating six different experiments. The purpose of these replications is to assess the reproducibility of reported experiments, examine the replicability of their results, and provide more accurate effect size estimates. Reproducibility was mixed, with several papers either lacking crucial details or containing errors in the description of method, making it difficult to ascertain what was done. Replicability was also mixed: although in every instance we confirmed above-chance statistical word segmentation, many theoretically important moderations of that learning failed to replicate. Moreover, learning success was generally much lower than in the original studies. In the General Discussion, we consider whether these differences are due to differences in subject populations, low power in the original studies, or some combination of these and other factors. We also consider whether these findings are likely to generalize to the broader statistical word segmentation literature.

Surprisingly, there is little consistency and transparency in preprocessing steps, making replicability and reproducibility difficult. To increase replicability, reproducibility, and transparency, a package in R (a free and widely used statistical programming environment) called gazeR was created to read and preprocess two types of data: gaze position and pupil size. For gaze position data, gazeR has functions for reading in raw eye-tracking data, formatting it for analysis, converting from gaze coordinates to areas of interest, and binning and aggregating data. For data from pupillometry studies, the gazeR package has functions for reading in and merging multiple raw pupil data files, removing observations with too much missing data, eliminating artifacts, blink identification and interpolation, subtractive baseline correction, and binning and aggregating data. The package is open-source and freely available for download and installation: . We provide step-by-step analyses of data from two tasks exemplifying the package's capabilities.

J	Gobo, G				Gobo, Giampietro			Replicability. Politics and Poetics of Accountability, Validation and Legitimation	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						replicability; reliability; validity; politics of validation; credibility; repeatability; reproducibility; findings legitimation		Replicability is a term that not only comes with different meanings in the literature of many domains but is often associated or confused with other terms such as 'reproducibility,' 'repeatability,' 'reliability,' 'validity,' and so on. To add to the confusion, it can even be used differently across diverse disciplines. Though all named concepts are important, what makes them barely advantageous is that they do not cover some peculiar aspects of the replicability and validation processes, i.e., appropriateness of conceptualization; trustworthiness of operational definition and operational acts; accuracy of researcher's description, categorization and/or measurement; successfulness of observational (or field) relation. Moreover, in social sciences and organization studies, the concept of validity of data is highly questionable due to the quite frequent shortage of real statuses of the observed objects. The present paper aims to challenge the received view on the concept of 'replicability,' by proposing a "situational approach" based on the idea that replicability works under certain organizational and socio-technic conditions, and that it is heavily influenced by the way that different stakeholders (scientists, technicians, participants artifacts, and technologies) respond to them. Consequently, it is important to understand how and why replicability works in different contexts. Its main purpose, without denying the importance of current conventional perspectives on replicability and its siblings, is to widen and change them to include an organizational setting and a reflexive epistemology. This implies the pursuit of a third way of replicability, between the postmodernist negation of its possibility and its opposite, i.e., a naive naturalism. A way asserting that replicability is a jigsaw puzzle or a mosaic, constituted by discursive practices (poetics) and organizational achievements guiding the politics of accountability, validation and legitimation. The domain here considered pertains to the social and organizational sciences.

J	Passmore, DL; Chae, C				Passmore, David L.; Chae, Chungil			Potential for Meta-Scientific Inquiry to Improve the Usefulness of HRD Research Outcomes for Practice	ADVANCES IN DEVELOPING HUMAN RESOURCES			English	Article						knowledge management; measurement; metrics; evidence-based practice; evaluation	REPRODUCIBLE RESEARCH; REPLICATION	The Problem Meta-science, that is, science about science, is an application of scientific method to explain and control the methods and enterprise of science. The field of inquiry of meta-science emerged originally in reaction to problems with reproducibility and replicability of seemingly settled science. These same problems could affect research evidence conducted by human resource development (HRD) researchers and, as a result, could limit the applicability of HRD research outcomes to HRD practice. The Solution Discussed in this article are examples of meta-scientific issues and solutions that ultimately affect the transition of knowledge derived through research to practice in the field of HRD. Problems with the reproducibility and replication of research conducted in the field are detailed as are meta-scientific issues involved in judging the quality of scientific work, methodology-agnostic applications of meta-scientific inquiry, requirements for sharing data and code, and the need to let theory guide research. The Stakeholders Researchers would benefit from the considerations of meta-scientific concerns in the design, conduct, and reporting of research to improve the replicability and reproducibility of research outcomes. Knowledge of meta-scientific principles and cautions by adopters of research outcomes would inject healthy skepticism into decisions about whether research outcomes are worthy for application in practice or to guide future research.

Histopathology is a key tool in biomedical research, in particular for the phenotyping of animal models to provide insights into the pathobiology of diseases. Failure to disclose and share crucial histopathological experimental details compromises the validity of the review process and reliability of the conclusions. We discuss factors that affect the interpretation and validation of histopathology data in publications and the importance of making these data accessible to promote replicability in research.

J	Hicks, DJ				Hicks, Daniel J.			Open science, the replication crisis, and environmental public health	ACCOUNTABILITY IN RESEARCH-POLICIES AND QUALITY ASSURANCE			English	Article						Replication crisis; open science; environmental public health; environmental policy	HARVARD 6 CITIES; AIR-POLLUTION; BIAS; FALSE; REPRODUCIBILITY; TRANSPARENCY; EPIDEMIOLOGY; REANALYSIS; FAILURES; MODEL	Concerns about a crisis of mass irreplicability across scientific fields ("the replication crisis") have stimulated a movement for open science, encouraging or even requiring researchers to publish their raw data and analysis code. Recently, a rule at the US Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) would have imposed a strong open data requirement. The rule prompted significant public discussion about whether open science practices are appropriate for fields of environmental public health. The aims of this paper are to assess (1) whether the replication crisis extends to fields of environmental public health; and (2) in general whether open science requirements can address the replication crisis. There is little empirical evidence for or against mass irreplicability in environmental public health specifically. Without such evidence, strong claims about whether the replication crisis extends to environmental public health - or not - seem premature. By distinguishing three concepts - reproducibility, replicability, and robustness - it is clear that open data initiatives can promote reproducibility and robustness but do little to promote replicability. I conclude by reviewing some of the other benefits of open science, and offer some suggestions for funding streams to mitigate the costs of adoption of open science practices in environmental public health.

J	Hensel, WM				Hensel, Witold M.			Double trouble? The communication dimension of the reproducibility crisis in experimental psychology and neuroscience	EUROPEAN JOURNAL FOR PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE			English	Article						Reproducibility crisis in experimental psychology and neuroscience; Replicability crisis in computational modeling; Replication; Reproduction; Norms of scientific reporting; Descriptive completeness	PUBLICATION DECISIONS; REPLICATION; GUIDELINES; SPECIFICATION; STANDARDS; TESTS; BIAS	Most discussions of the reproducibility crisis focus on its epistemic aspect: the fact that the scientific community fails to follow some norms of scientific investigation, which leads to high rates of irreproducibility via a high rate of false positive findings. The purpose of this paper is to argue that there is a heretofore underappreciated and understudied dimension to the reproducibility crisis in experimental psychology and neuroscience that may prove to be at least as important as the epistemic dimension. This is the communication dimension. The link between communication and reproducibility is immediate: independent investigators would not be able to recreate an experiment whose design or implementation were inadequately described. I exploit evidence of a replicability and reproducibility crisis in computational science, as well as research into quality of reporting to support the claim that a widespread failure to adhere to reporting standards, especially the norm of descriptive completeness, is an important contributing factor in the current reproducibility crisis in experimental psychology and neuroscience.

In computational neuroscience, there are thousands of models available. However, it is rarely possible to reimplement the models based on the information in the original publication, let alone rerun the models just because the model implementations have not been made publicly available. We evaluate and discuss the comparability of a versatile choice of simulation tools: tools for biochemical reactions and spiking neuronal networks, and relatively new tools for growth in cell cultures. The replicability and reproducibility issues are considered for computational models that are equally diverse, including the models for intracellular signal transduction of neurons and glial cells, in addition to single glial cells, neuron-glia interactions, and selected examples of spiking neuronal networks. We also address the comparability of the simulation results with one another to comprehend if the studied models can be used to answer similar research questions. In addition to presenting the challenges in reproducibility and replicability of published results in computational neuroscience, we highlight the need for developing recommendations and good practices for publishing simulation tools and computational models. Model validation and flexible model description must be an integral part of the tool used to simulate and develop computational models. Constant improvement on experimental techniques and recording protocols leads to increasing knowledge about the biophysical mechanisms in neural systems. This poses new challenges for computational neuroscience: extended or completely new computational methods and models may be required. Careful evaluation and categorization of the existing models and tools provide a foundation for these future needs, for constructing multiscale models or extending the models to incorporate additional or more detailed biophysical mechanisms. Improving the quality of publications in computational neuroscience, enabling progressive building of advanced computational models and tools, can be achieved only through adopting publishing standards which underline replicability and reproducibility of research results.

To this end, we put forth a taxonomy that defines an environmental modelling study as being either 1) repeatable, 2) runnable, 3) reproducible, or 4) replicable. We introduce these terms with illustrative examples from hydrology using a hydrologic modelling framework along with cyberin-frastructure aimed at fostering reproducibility. Using this taxonomy as a guide, we argue that containerization is an important but lacking component needed to achieve the goal of computational reproducibility in hydrology and environmental modelling. Examples from hydrology are provided to demonstrate how new tools, including a user-friendly tool for containerization of computational analyses called Sciunit, can lower the barrier to reproducibility and replicability in the environmental modelling community.

The understandability and replicability of these analyses may be harmed by inconsistencies in how the probability distributions central to Bayesian methods are represented in the literature. Herein advice is provided on how to report the results of Bayesian analysis as applied to neutron and X-ray reflectometry. This includes the clear reporting of initial starting conditions, the prior probabilities, the results of any analysis and the posterior probabilities that are the Bayesian equivalent of the error bar, to enable replicability and improve understanding. It is believed that this advice, grounded in the authors' experience working in the field, will enable greater analytical reproducibility in the work of the reflectometry community, and improve the quality and usability of results.

Replicability of the EC-Earth3 Earth system model under a change in computing environment	GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT			English	Article							HYDROLOGY; SOFTWARE; ERRORS; IMPACT	Most Earth system models (ESMs) are running under different high-performance computing (HPC) environments. This has several advantages, from allowing different groups to work with the same tool in parallel to leveraging the burden of ensemble climate simulations, but it also offers alternative solutions in the case of shutdown (expected or not) of any of the environments. However, for obvious scientific reasons, it is critical to ensure that ESMs provide identical results under changes in computing environment. While strict bit-for-bit reproducibility is not always guaranteed with ESMs, it is desirable that results obtained under one computing environment are at least statistically indistinguishable from those obtained under another environment, which we term a "replicability" condition following the metrology nomenclature. Here, we develop a protocol to assess the replicability of the EC-Earth ESM. Using two versions of EC-Earth, we present one case of non-replicability and one case of replicability. The non-replicable case occurs with the older version of the model and likely finds its origin in the treatment of river runoff along Antarctic coasts. By contrast, the more recent version of the model provides replicable results. The methodology presented here has been adopted as a standard test by the EC-Earth consortium (27 institutions in Europe) to evaluate the replicability of any new model version across platforms, including for CMIP6 experiments. To a larger extent, it can be used to assess whether other ESMs can safely be ported from one HPC environment to another for studying climate-related questions. Our results and experience with this work suggest that the default assumption should be that ESMs are not replicable under changes in the HPC environment, until proven otherwise.

Investigating the replicability of preclinical cancer biology	ELIFE			English	Article							PUBLICATION BIAS; REPLICATION; REPRODUCIBILITY; METAANALYSIS; INCENTIVES; INCREASE; SCIENCE; TRUTH	Replicability is an important feature of scientific research, but aspects of contemporary research culture, such as an emphasis on novelty, can make replicability seem less important than it should be. The Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology was set up to provide evidence about the replicability of preclinical research in cancer biology by repeating selected experiments from highimpact papers. A total of 50 experiments from 23 papers were repeated, generating data about the replicability of a total of 158 effects. Most of the original effects were positive effects (136), with the rest being null effects (22). A majority of the original effect sizes were reported as numerical values (117), with the rest being reported as representative images (41). We employed seven methods to assess replicability, and some of these methods were not suitable for all the effects in our sample. One method compared effect sizes: for positive effects, the median effect size in the replications was 85% smaller than the median effect size in the original experiments, and 92% of replication effect sizes were smaller than the original. The other methods were binary - the replication was either a success or a failure - and five of these methods could be used to assess both positive and null effects when effect sizes were reported as numerical values. For positive effects, 40% of replications (39/97) succeeded according to three or more of these five methods, and for null effects 80% of replications (12/15) were successful on this basis; combining positive and null effects, the success rate was 46% (51/112). A successful replication does not definitively confirm an original finding or its theoretical interpretation. Equally, a failure to replicate does not disconfirm a finding, but it does suggest that additional investigation is needed to establish its reliability.

MouseBytes, an open-access high-throughput pipeline and database for rodent touchscreen-based cognitive assessment	ELIFE			English	Article							ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; OPERANT PLATFORM; TRANSGENIC MICE; RETINAL DEGENERATION; SUSTAINED ATTENTION; IMPAIRED ATTENTION; EXECUTIVE FUNCTION; MEMORY DEFICITS; SEX-DIFFERENCES; WORKING-MEMORY	Open Science has changed research by making data accessible and shareable, contributing to replicability to accelerate and disseminate knowledge. However, for rodent cognitive studies the availability of tools to share and disseminate data is scarce. Automated touchscreen-based tests enable systematic cognitive assessment with easily standardised outputs that can facilitate data dissemination. Here we present an integration of touchscreen cognitive testing with an open-access database public repository (mousebytes.ca), as well as a Web platform for knowledge dissemination (https://touchscreencognition.org) We complement these resources with the largest dataset of age-dependent high-level cognitive assessment of mouse models of Alzheimer's disease, expanding knowledge of affected cognitive domains from male and female mice of three strains. We envision that these new platforms will enhance sharing of protocols, data availability and transparency, allowing meta-analysis and reuse of mouse cognitive data to increase the replicability/reproducibility of datasets.

In May 2020, certain changes were made to its search algorithm, which at first sight improves the location of scientific articles, but upon analyzing its operation in more depth, we detected some changes that make the reproducibility of bibliographic searches difficult. In order to safeguard the reproducibility and replicability of the searches carried out for systematic reviews, narratives and meta-analyzes, we suggest accompanying these strategies with a file in a format compatible with reference managers, to facilitate comparison and verification of the strategy to be replicated in a future.

This so-called "replication crisis" has spurred calls for open science practices, which aim to increase the reproducibility, replicability, and generalizability of findings. Communication research is subject to many of the same challenges that have caused low replicability in other fields. As a result, we propose an agenda for adopting open science practices in Communication, which includes the following seven suggestions: (1) publish materials, data, and code; (2) preregister studies and submit registered reports; (3) conduct replications; (4) collaborate; (5) foster open science skills; (6) implement Transparency and Openness Promotion Guidelines; and (7) incentivize open science practices. Although in our agenda we focus mostly on quantitative research, we also reflect on open science practices relevant to qualitative research. We conclude by discussing potential objections and concerns associated with open science practices.

This event brought together educators, researchers, students, policy makers, and industry representatives from across the globe to explore best practices, innovations, and new ideas for education around reproducibility and replicability. Emphasizing a broad view of rigor and reproducibility, the conference touched on many aspects of introducing learners to transparency, rigorous study design, data science, data management, replications, and more. Transdisciplinary themes emerged from the panels, keynote, and submitted papers and poster presentations. The identified themes included lifelong learning, cultivating bottom-up change, "sneaking in" learning, just-in-time learning, targeting learners by career stage, learning by doing, learning how to learn, establishing communities of practice, librarians as interdisciplinary leaders, teamwork skills, rewards and incentives, and implementing top-down change. For each of these themes, we share ideas, practices, and actions as discussed by the conference speakers and attendees.

In the context of smart grids, the collection of vast amounts of data has seen the emergence of a plethora of data analysis approaches. In this article, we conduct a systematic mapping study aimed at getting insights about different facets of SG data analysis: application subdomains (e.g., power load control), aspects covered (e.g., forecasting), used techniques (e.g., clustering), tool support, research methods (e.g., experiments/simulations), and replicability/reproducibility of research. The final goal is to provide a view of the current status of research. Overall, we found that each subdomain has its peculiarities in terms of techniques, approaches, and research methodologies applied. Simulations and experiments play a crucial role in many areas. The replicability of studies is limited concerning the provided implemented algorithms, and to a lower extent due to the usage of private datasets.

Narrowing the translational research gap by aligning replication concepts in basic and clinical neuroscience	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Replicability; Reproducibility; Translational neuroscience; Neural circuits; Clinical trials	REPRODUCIBILITY	Replicability and reproducibility are widely considered to be cornerstones of valid scientific research. Yet, the elements of replication in fundamental neuroscience studies do not fully overlap with the process of replication in clinical neuroscience involving patients. Here we discuss how better aligning the concept of replication across this translational spectrum might enhance the rate at which basic findings in the organization and function of the nervous system are leveraged to develop new treatments for psychiatric and neurological disorders.

Recently, ICNs have become popular for investigating brain functioning and brain-behavior relationships. However, the replicability and neurometrics of these networks are only beginning to be reported. Using a meta-level independent component analysis (ICA), we produced ICNs from three data sets collected from two samples of healthy adults. The ICNs from our data sets demonstrated robust and independent replication of 12 intrinsic networks that reflected 17 canonical, task-based, brain networks. We found within-subject reliability of ICNs was modest overall, but ranged from poor to good, and that voxels with the highest measured connectivity rarely had the highest reliability. Networks associated with executive functions, visuospatial reasoning, motor coordination, speech and audition, default mode, vision, and interoception showed moderate to high group-level reproducibility and replicability. However, only the first four of these networks also showed fair or better within-subject reliability over time. Our findings highlight the replicability of ICNs across data sets, the range of within-subject neurometrics across different networks, and the shared characteristics between resting and task-based networks.

Identifying and Overcoming Threats to Reproducibility, Replicability, Robustness, and Generalizability in Microbiome Research	MBIO			English	Article						American Academy of Microbiology; microbiome; reproducibility; research ethics; scientific method	GUT MICROBIOME; OBESITY; DATABASE; IMPACT	The "reproducibility crisis" in science affects microbiology as much as any other area of inquiry, and microbiologists have long struggled to make their research reproducible. We need to respect that ensuring that our methods and results are sufficiently transparent is difficult. This difficulty is compounded in interdisciplinary fields such as microbiome research. There are many reasons why a researcher is unable to reproduce a previous result, and even if a result is reproducible, it may not be correct. Furthermore, failures to reproduce previous results have much to teach us about the scientific process and microbial life itself. This Perspective delineates a framework for identifying and overcoming threats to reproducibility, replicability, robustness, and generalizability of microbiome research. Instead of seeing signs of a crisis in others' work, we need to appreciate the technical and social difficulties that limit reproducibility in the work of others as well as our own.

J	Wainwright, J				Wainwright, Joel			Is Critical Human Geography Research Replicable?	ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF GEOGRAPHERS			English	Article						critical human geography; replicability; reproducible geographical research	SCIENCE	The debate concerning replicable scientific research has reached geography's shores. This has exposed old fault lines in our discipline, because some forms of geographical inquiry are more amenable to replicability than others. If there is a corner of the discipline that seems especially ill-suited to replicability, it is critical human geography. Almost no work in the subfield exhibits the combination of qualities-explicit and replicable methods; large, numerical data sets; full reporting-that enable reproducibility. Should we care? Although the inability of critical human geographers to reproduce our research results does not constitute a crisis, it is a matter worthy of reflection. Even if it proves difficult to realize, the challenge of designing replicable research promises to generate insights into the relative rigor of our disciplinary practices. Moreover, by clarifying the limits on replicability in social inquiry, we should be better positioned to weigh and mediate between competing values, for instance, the potential conflict between the principle of scientific integrity and the protection of vulnerable research subjects. I contend that producing a rigorous and reproducible geographical research, while also respecting the dignity of subaltern social groups, would require significant changes to standard research practice. To flesh out these claims, I offer concise reflections on the literature from critical human geography research with subaltern social groups.

To improve transparency, commentators have stressed that research articles contain detail about procedural replicability, thus allowing for results reproducibility, at least (in the case of samples) across multiple trials. For all its merit, such advice neglects the particularised role of language in conveying scientific findings. This article argues that embracing positivist epistemology in management and business research entails adhering to linguistic standards. It is through such adherence that transparency is realised.

Despite the popularity of these comparisons, the implementation is often ad hoc, with little consistency across studies. To address this problem, we developed Summarized Benchmark, an R package and framework for organizing and structuring benchmark comparisons. Summarized Benchmark defines a general grammar for benchmarking and allows for easier setup and execution of benchmark comparisons, while improving the reproducibility and replicability of such comparisons. We demonstrate the wide applicability of our framework using four examples from different applications.

Going forward, the field would benefit from an increased emphasis on effect sizes and more prevalent use of meta-analysis to evaluate replicability. We also encourage direct replication attempts and sharing data and code to facilitate reproducibility. Objective: The high rate of statistically significant findings in the sciences that do not replicate in a new sample has been described as a "replication crisis." Few replication attempts have been conducted in studies of alcohol use disorder (AUD), and the best method for determining whether a finding replicates has not been explored. The goal of the current study was to conduct direct replications within a multisite AUD-randomized controlled trial and to test a range of replication metrics. Method: We used data from a large AUD clinical trial (Project Matching Alcoholism Treatments and Client Heterogeneity [Project MATCH], n = 1,726) to simulate direct replication attempts. We examined associations between drinking intensity and negative alcohol-related consequences (Model 1), sex differences in drinking intensity (Model 2), and reductions in drinking following treatment (Model 3). We treated each of the 11 data collection sites as unique studies such that each subsample was treated as an "original" study, and the remaining 10 subsamples were viewed as "replication" studies. Replicability metrics included the consistency of statistical significance, overlapping confidence intervals, and consistency of the direction of the effect. We also tested effect replication and heterogeneity using meta-analysis. Results: We observed between 0% and 100% replicability across the replicability metrics depending on which subsample was treated as the "original" study. Meta-analyses indicated results were more similar across subsamples with no significant heterogeneity for Models 1 and 2. Conclusions: We recommend researchers focus on effect sizes and use meta-analysis to evaluate the level of replicability.

J	Liao, SJ; Qin, SJ				Liao, Shijun; Qin, Shijie			Ultra-Chaos: an Insurmountable Objective Obstacle of Reproducibility and Replication	ADVANCES IN APPLIED MATHEMATICS AND MECHANICS			English	Article						&nbsp; Chaos; statistical stability; reproducibility and replication	HYPERCHAOS; EQUATION	In this paper, a new concept, i.e., ultra-chaos, is proposed for the first time. Unlike a normal-chaos, statistical properties such as the probability density functions (PDF) of an ultra-chaos are sensitive to tiny disturbances. We illustrate that ultra-chaos is widely existed and thus has general scientific meanings. It is found that statistical non-reproducibility is an inherent property of an ultra-chaos so that an ultra-chaos is at a higher-level of disorder than a normal-chaos. Thus, it is impossible in practice to replicate experimental/numerical results of an ultra-chaos even in statistical meanings, since random environmental noises always exist and are out of control. Thus, the ultra-chaos should be an insurmountable obstacle of reproducibility and replicability. Similar to Go center dot del's incompleteness theorem, such kind of "incompleteness of reproducibility" reveals a limitation of our traditional scientific paradigm based on reproducible experiments, which can be traced back to Galileo. The ultra-chaos opens a new door and possibility to study chaos theory, turbulence theory, computational fluid dynamics (CFD), the statistical significance, reproducibility crisis, and so on.

Mitigation Strategies to Improve Reproducibility of Poverty Estimations From Remote Sensing Images Using Deep Learning	EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE			English	Article						reproducibility; Deep-Learning; data-sharing; remote sensing imagery; street-level imagery; FAIR	SATELLITE IMAGERY	The challenges of Reproducibility and Replicability (R & R) in computer science experiments have become a focus of attention in the last decade, as efforts to adhere to good research practices have increased. However, experiments using Deep Learning (DL) remain difficult to reproduce due to the complexity of the techniques used. Challenges such as estimating poverty indicators (e.g., wealth index levels) from remote sensing imagery, requiring the use of huge volumes of data across different geographic locations, would be impossible without the use of DL technology. To test the reproducibility of DL experiments, we report a review of the reproducibility of three DL experiments which analyze visual indicators from satellite and street imagery. For each experiment, we identify the challenges found in the data sets, methods and workflows used. As a result of this assessment we propose a checklist incorporating relevant FAIR principles to screen an experiment for its reproducibility. Based on the lessons learned from this study, we recommend a set of actions aimed to improve the reproducibility of such experiments and reduce the likelihood of wasted effort. We believe that the target audience is broad, from researchers seeking to reproduce an experiment, authors reporting an experiment, or reviewers seeking to assess the work of others.

J	Ahlgren, J; Voikar, V				Ahlgren, Johanna; Voikar, Vootele			Experiments done in Black-6 mice: what does it mean?	LAB ANIMAL			English	Article							BEHAVIORAL-TEST BATTERIES; EMBRYONIC STEM-CELLS; C57BL/6 SUBSTRAINS; INBRED STRAINS; MOUSE; GENE; REPRODUCIBILITY; KNOCKOUT; MUTATION; STRESS	Low replicability of animal experiments is perceived as a major hurdle in the field of biomedicine. Attempts to enhance the replicability and to reduce the variability in basic research has led to the recommendation to use isogenic mice. The C57BL/6 strain has evolved as a gold standard strain for this purpose. However, C57BL/6 mice are maintained as substrains by multiple vendors. Evidence exists that the subtle differences between these mouse lines have not been systematically investigated and are often ignored. In the present study, we characterized the female mice of two closely related substrains (C57BL/6J and C57BL/6N) from three vendors in Europe (Charles River Laboratories, Envigo, Janvier Labs) in a battery of behavioral tests. Our data show and confirm substantial behavioral differences between the C57BL/6J and C57BL/6N mice. Importantly, the substrain differences were largely affected by the origin of the animals, as a significant effect of vendor or interaction between the substrain and vendor occurred in all tests. This work highlights the importance of adhering to precise international nomenclature in all publications reporting animal experiments. Moreover, the generalization of research findings from a single mouse substrain can be seriously limited due to genetic drift and environmental variables occurring at different vendors. However, heterogenization of samples, by including animals of different substrains, can enhance generalizability. These issues need to be seriously addressed to improve reproducibility, replicability, and the translational potential of the mouse models.

BMC SYSTEMS BIOLOGY			English	Article						Reproducibility; Replicability; Extensibility; Communication; Policy; Education	COMMUNITY STANDARD; MODELS; REPRESENTATION; GALAXY	Background: The concept of reproducibility is a foundation of the scientific method. With the arrival of fast and powerful computers over the last few decades, there has been an explosion of results based on complex computational analyses and simulations. The reproducibility of these results has been addressed mainly in terms of exact replicability or numerical equivalence, ignoring the wider issue of the reproducibility of conclusions through equivalent, extended or alternative methods. Results: We use case studies from our own research experience to illustrate how concepts of reproducibility might be applied in computational biology. Several fields have developed 'minimum information' checklists to support the full reporting of computational simulations, analyses and results, and standardised data formats and model description languages can facilitate the use of multiple systems to address the same research question. We note the importance of defining the key features of a result to be reproduced, and the expected agreement between original and subsequent results. Dynamic, updatable tools for publishing methods and results are becoming increasingly common, but sometimes come at the cost of clear communication. In general, the reproducibility of computational research is improving but would benefit from additional resources and incentives. Conclusions: We conclude with a series of linked recommendations for improving reproducibility in computational biology through communication, policy, education and research practice. More reproducible research will lead to higher quality conclusions, deeper understanding and more valuable knowledge.

B-value and empirical equivalence bound: A new procedure of hypothesis testing	STATISTICS IN MEDICINE			English	Article						empirical equivalence bound; equivalence test; hypothesis testing	CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS; COMPARATIVE BIOAVAILABILITY; POWER	In this study, we propose a two-stage procedure for hypothesis testing, where the first stage is conventional hypothesis testing and the second is an equivalence testing procedure using an introduced empirical equivalence bound (EEB). In 2016, the American Statistical Association released a policy statement on P-values to clarify the proper use and interpretation in response to the criticism of reproducibility and replicability in scientific findings. A recent solution to improve reproducibility and transparency in statistical hypothesis testing is to integrate P-values (or confidence intervals) with practical or scientific significance. Similar ideas have been proposed via the equivalence test, where the goal is to infer equality under a presumption (null) of inequality of parameters. However, the definition of scientific significance/equivalence can sometimes be ill-justified and subjective. To circumvent this drawback, we introduce the B-value and the EEB, which are both estimated from the data. Performing a second-stage equivalence test, our procedure offers an opportunity to improve the reproducibility of findings across studies.

Materials and Methods RGD-alginate was used to produce empty capsules or to encapsulate neonatal porcine islets (NPI) with different combinations of human pancreatic extracellular matrix (hpECM), porcine mesenchymal stem cells (pMSC) and a chitosan anti-fouling coating. Capsules were transplanted subcutaneously in rats for one month and then processed for immunohistochemistry. Immunostainings for macrophages (CD68) and lymphocytes (CD3) were quantified by DIA in two concentric regions of interest (ROI) around the capsules. DIA replicability and reproducibility were assessed by two blind operators. Repeatability was evaluated by processing the same biopsies at different time points. DIA was also compared with quantification by point counting (PC). Results Methodology validation: different sizes of ROIs were highly correlated. Intraclass correlation coefficients confirmed replicability and reproducibility. Repeatability showed a very strong correlation with CD3 stains and moderate/strong for CD68 stains. Group comparisons for CD68 IHC at each time point proved internal consistency. Point counting and DIA were strongly correlated with both CD3 and CD68. Capsule biocompatibility: Macrophage infiltration was higher around capsules containing biomaterials than around empty and RGD-alginate-NPI capsules. Lymphocytic infiltration was comparable among groups containing cells and higher than in empty capsules. Conclusion We validated a semi-automated quantification methodology to assess cellular infiltrates and successfully applied it to investigate graft biocompatibility, showing that neonatal porcine islets encapsulated in alginate alone triggered less infiltration than capsules containing islets and bioactive materials.

On reproducibility and replicability: Arguing for open science practices and methodological improvements at the South African Journal of Industrial Psychology	SA JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Open science; replication; reproducibility; industrial psychology; organisational psychology; academic publishing	QUESTIONABLE RESEARCH PRACTICES; ORGANIZATIONAL-PSYCHOLOGY; POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGY; SAMPLE-SIZE; MANAGEMENT; REPLICATION; PUBLICATIONS; PREVALENCE; STANDARDS; CRISIS	Problematisation: In recent years, psychology has been going through a crisis of sorts. Research methods and practices have come under increased scrutiny, with many issues identified as negatively contributing to low replicability and reproducibility of psychological research. Implications: As a consequence, researchers are increasingly called upon to overhaul and improve their research process. Various stakeholders within the scientific community are arguing for more openness and rigor within industrial and organisational (I-O) psychological research. A lack of transparency and openness further fuels criticisms as to the credibility and trustworthiness of I-O psychology which negatively affects the evidence-based practices which it supports. Furthermore, traditional gate-keepers such as grant agencies, professional societies and journals, are adapting their policies, reflecting an effort to curtail these trends. Purpose: The purpose of this opinion paper is, therefore, to stimulate an open dialogue with the South African Journal of Industrial Psychology (SAJIP) contributing authors, its editorial board and readership about the challenges associated with the replication crisis in psychology. Furthermore, it attempts to discuss how the identified issues affect I-O psychology and how these could be managed through open science practices and other structural improvements within the SAJIP. Recommendations: We enumerate several easily implementable open science practices, methodological improvements and editorial policy enhancements to enhance credibility and transparency within the SAJIP. Relying on these, we recommend changes to the current practices that can be taken up by researchers and the SAJIP to improve reproducibility and replicability in I-O psychological science.

Working With Psychology Journal Editors to Correct Problems in the Scientific Literature	CANADIAN PSYCHOLOGY-PSYCHOLOGIE CANADIENNE			English	Article						debunking; editors; replicability; reproducibility; scientific culture	COMPLEX DYNAMICS; REANALYSIS	Psychology faces a replicability crisis in which its credibility as a science is in question. A recommended prerequisite to exploring replicability is to first explore reproducibility by carefully reexamining existing studies for any internal problems prior to attempting to externally replicate them. However, a frequent complaint from people attempting to get errors found in existing studies corrected within the psychological literature is some journal editors' reticence to publish critical comments, and especially to issue corrections and retractions, on articles found to be problematic. These editors seem to view criticisms as negative and destructive, rather than positive and constructive, and can obstruct important corrections needed for psychological science to be more adaptive. As powerful gatekeepers, editors play a crucial role in perpetuating a dysfunctional scientific culture that undermines psychology's viability. However, effective advocacy can successfully challenge editors' resistance to publishing corrections and taking other responsible actions, as well as confront pushback from authors' attempts to shield their criticized articles from scrutiny. We present reproducibility efforts that resulted in a debunking article, several critical commentaries, and a letter to the editor being published, as well as several published corrections and an expression of concern, but no retractions. We discuss these examples in terms of confronting what we see as a dysfunctional culture that often protects the status quo by opposing corrections, which is analyzed as a perverse incentive. We also offer suggestions for changing this dysfunctional culture into one that is more in accord with science as an adaptive, self-correcting system.

This moment of change-in which science turns inward to examine its methods and practices-provides an opportunity to address its historic lack of diversity and noninclusive culture. Through network modeling and semantic analysis, we provide an initial exploration of the structure, cultural frames, and women's participation in the open science and reproducibility literatures (n = 2,926 articles and conference proceedings). Network analyses suggest that the open science and reproducibility literatures are emerging relatively independently of each other, sharing few common papers or authors. We next examine whether the literatures differentially incorporate collaborative, prosocial ideals that are known to engage members of underrepresented groups more than independent, winner-takes-all approaches. We find that open science has a more connected, collaborative structure than does reproducibility. Semantic analyses of paper abstracts reveal that these literatures have adopted different cultural frames: open science includes more explicitly communal and prosocial language than does reproducibility. Finally, consistent with literature suggesting the diversity benefits of communal and prosocial purposes, we find that women publish more frequently in high-status author positions (first or last) within open science (vs. reproducibility). Furthermore, this finding is further patterned by team size and time. Women are more represented in larger teams within reproducibility, and women's participation is increasing in open science over time and decreasing in reproducibility. We conclude with actionable suggestions for cultivating a more prosocial and diverse culture of science.

Multi-factorial examination of amplicon sequencing workflows from sample preparation to bioinformatic analysis	BMC MICROBIOLOGY			English	Article						16S rRNA; QIIME2; Mothur; DADA2; PCR artifacts; PCR biases; PCR errors; Chimera; Polymerase; Sequencing errors	PCR CYCLE NUMBER; MICROBIAL DIVERSITY; INFERENCE; DECIPHER; PRIMERS	Background The development of sequencing technologies to evaluate bacterial microbiota composition has allowed new insights into the importance of microbial ecology. However, the variety of methodologies used among amplicon sequencing workflows leads to uncertainty about best practices as well as reproducibility and replicability among microbiome studies. Using a bacterial mock community composed of 37 soil isolates, we performed a comprehensive methodological evaluation of workflows, each with a different combination of methodological factors spanning sample preparation to bioinformatic analysis to define sources of artifacts that affect coverage, accuracy, and biases in the resulting compositional profiles. Results Of the workflows examined, those using the V4-V4 primer set enabled the highest level of concordance between the original mock community and resulting microbiome sequence composition. Use of a high-fidelity polymerase, or a lower-fidelity polymerase with an increased PCR elongation time, limited chimera formation. Bioinformatic pipelines presented a trade-off between the fraction of distinct community members identified (coverage) and fraction of correct sequences (accuracy). DADA2 and QIIME2 assembled V4-V4 reads amplified by Taq polymerase resulted in the highest accuracy (100%) but had a coverage of only 52%. Using mothur to assemble and denoise V4-V4 reads resulted in a coverage of 75%, albeit with marginally lower accuracy (99.5%). Conclusions Optimization of microbiome workflows is critical for accuracy and to support reproducibility and replicability among microbiome studies. These considerations will help reveal the guiding principles of microbial ecology and impact the translation of microbiome research to human and environmental health.

We address these issues by suggesting that modellers (1) "trace" the iterative modelling process by keeping a modelling notebook corresponding to the laboratory notebooks used by empirical researchers, (2) use a standardized notebook structure and terminology based on the existing TRACE documentation framework, and (3) use their notebooks to compile TRACE documents that supplement publications and reports. These practices have benefits for model developers, users, and stakeholders: improved and efficient model design, analysis, testing, and application; increased model acceptance and reuse; and replicability and reproducibility of the model and the simulation experiments. Using TRACE terminology and structure in modelling notebooks facilitates production of TRACE documents. We explain the rationale of TRACE, provide example TRACE documents, and suggest strategies for keeping "TRACE Modelling Notebooks."

The architecture of Webchain, a new system enabling source and reference verifiability on the Web, is combining distributed ledger technologies with secure timestamping to ensure the history of creation, ownership, and referential integrity of online resources. We present the architecture and system extensions, conduct a security analysis, and evaluate theWebchain system based on a comprehensive prototype implementation. The results confirm the feasibility and robustness of our approach.

This is because the replicability and reproducibility of artworks seem to have reduced them to mere objects, largely indistinguishable from ordinary ones - Marcel Duchamp's ready-mades being the first clear example of this. Nevertheless, this paper will show that exemplarity is still alive in contemporary art, even though normativity has taken a new configuration. It explores the specific character of exemplarity, as well as its normativity, in the contemporary visual and performing arts, showing that art is still the place in which ordinary life transfigures in a new dimension.

J	Pleiss, J				Pleiss, Juergen			Standardized Data, Scalable Documentation, Sustainable Storage - EnzymeML as a Basis for FAIR Data Management in Biocatalysis	CHEMCATCHEM			English	Article						Application Programming Interface; enzymatic reactions; FAIR data principles; reproducibility crisis; STRENDA Guidelines	INFORMATION; ACCESS; SYSTEM	The often reported reproducibility crisis in the biomedical sciences also applies to enzymology and biocatalysis, and mainly results from incomplete reporting of reaction conditions. In this Concept article, an infrastructure based on EnzymeML is sketched, which enables reporting, exchange, and storage of enzymatic data according to the FAIR data principles. EnzymeML is a novel data exchange format for enzymology and biocatalysis, which facilitates the application of the STRENDA Guidelines and thus makes data on enzyme-catalyzed reactions findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable. EnzymeML enables the comprehensive documentation of metadata, thus fostering reproducibility and replicability in enzymology and biocatalysis. An EnzymeML Application Programming Interface integrates electronic lab notebooks with modelling platforms and databases on enzymatic reactions, and thus enables the seamless flow of enzymatic data from measurement to modelling to publication, without the need for manual intervention such as reformatting or editing. EnzymeML serves as a valuable tool for the design of biocatalytic experiments and contributes to the vision of a unified research data infrastructure for catalysis research.

J	Gonzalez, VS; Schmidt, AH; Bierman, PR; Rood, DH				Gonzalez, Veronica Sosa; Schmidt, Amanda H.; Bierman, Paul R.; Rood, Dylan H.			Spatial and temporal replicability of meteoric and in situ Be-10 concentrations in fluvial sediment	EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS			English	Article						temporal replicates; spatial replicates; cosmogenic; variability; detrital sediment	DENUDATION RATES; EROSION RATES; COSMOGENIC BE-10; WATER-QUALITY; RIVER-BASIN; LANDSLIDES; CATCHMENT; NUCLIDES; YUNNAN; SLOPE	Cosmogenic isotopes, short-lived radionuclides, elemental concentrations and thermochronometric indicators are measured in river sand to quantify erosion rates and trace sediment sources, and/or infer erosional processes. Interpretations of detrital sediment analyses are often based on the rarely tested assumption of time-invariant tracer concentration. A better understanding of when and where this assumption breaks down and what sampling strategies minimize temporal and small-scale spatial variance will improve science done using detrital river sediment. Here, we present new and previously published spatial and temporal replicates measured for in situ and meteoric Be-10 (Be-10(i) and Be-10(m), respectively). Our new data include 113 replicate pairs, taken from agricultural and/or tectonically active watersheds in China months to millennia apart and spatial replicates taken up to 2 km apart on the same day. The mean percentage difference is 10% (-122% to 150%) for both systems considered together; the mode is close to 0% for both systems; and 36% of pairs of samples replicate within our analytical accuracy at 2 sigma. We find that Be-10(i) replicates better than Be-10(m) (p < 0.01). Be-10(i) replicability is worse in steeper basins, suggesting that stochastic processes (i.e. landslides) affect reproducibility. Be-10(m) replicability is worse in larger basins, suggesting non-conservative behavior of Be-10(m) as sediment moves downstream. Our results are consistent with the few previously published replicate studies. Considering all replicate data in a wide range of landscapes, in areas with deep erosional processes, replicability is poor; in other areas, replicability is good. This suggests that, in steep, tectonically active, and/or agricultural landscapes, individual detrital sediment measurements do not represent upstream rates as well as larger populations of samples. To ensure that measurements are representative of the upstream watershed, our data suggest that samples be amalgamated either over time or from several places close by in the same channel.

Replication experiments were completed and Replication Studies reporting the results were submitted for 18 papers, of which 17 were accepted and published by eLife with the rejected paper posted as a preprint. Here, we report the status and outcomes obtained for the remaining 11 papers. Four papers initiated experimental work but were stopped without any experimental outcomes. Two papers resulted in incomplete outcomes due to unanticipated challenges when conducting the experiments. For the remaining five papers only some of the experiments were completed with the other experiments incomplete due to mundane technical or unanticipated methodological challenges. The experiments from these papers, along with the other experiments attempted as part of the Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology, provides evidence about the challenges of repeating preclinical cancer biology experiments and the replicability of the completed experiments.

J	Fletcher, SC				Fletcher, Samuel C.			How (not) to measure replication	EUROPEAN JOURNAL FOR PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE			English	Article						Replicability crisis; Reproducability crisis; Null hypothesis significance testing; Effect size; Confidence interval; Meta-analysis	REPRODUCIBILITY; REPLICABILITY; METAANALYSIS; PSYCHOLOGY; KNOWLEDGE	The replicability crisis refers to the apparent failures to replicate both important and typical positive experimental claims in psychological science and biomedicine, failures which have gained increasing attention in the past decade. In order to provide evidence that there is a replicability crisis in the first place, scientists have developed various measures of replication that help quantify or "count" whether one study replicates another. In this nontechnical essay, I critically examine five types of replication measures used in the landmark article "Estimating the reproducibility of psychological science" (Open Science Collaboration, Science, 349, ac4716, 2015) based on the following techniques: subjective assessment, null hypothesis significance testing, comparing effect sizes, comparing the original effect size with the replication confidence interval, and meta-analysis. The first four, I argue, remain unsatisfactory for a variety of conceptual or formal reasons, even taking into account various improvements. By contrast, at least one version of the meta-analytic measure does not suffer from these problems. It differs from the others in rejecting dichotomous conclusions, the assumption that one study replicates another or not simpliciter. I defend it from other recent criticisms, concluding however that it is not a panacea for all the multifarious problems that the crisis has highlighted.

J	Frery, AC; Gomez, L; Medeiros, AC				Frery, Alejandro C.; Gomez, Luis; Medeiros, Antonio C.			A Badging System for Reproducibility and Replicability in Remote Sensing Research	IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Remote sensing; Software; Oceans; Libraries; Web pages; Earth; Industries; Remote sensing; replicability; reproducibility		Remote Sensing is both an active research area and the source of valuable information for decision-making. Many actors play a fundamental role in Remote Sensing, from industry (public or private) to large or small research groups. From that intensive activity, methods, algorithms, and techniques are continuously published or broadcasted through papers, conference presentations, repositories, patents, standards, and other means. The consumers of that information need it to be readily available and dependable. Reproducible research can handle those needs. In this article, we discuss two concepts: reproducibility and replicability in the context of Remote Sensing research. We propose a badging system suited to the specifics of the Remote Sensing community. Such a system aims at both recognizing the level of the reproducibility of the research, and to help increase its visibility. We show examples of reproducible research and provide clues to make easier the transition to the inevitable new times that embrace contemporary science and technology.

At the same time, this study design remains complex with numerous issues related to the planning, implementation, and analysis of such trials. In this systematic review, we expand previous reviews, and evaluate reporting of the statistical methods used for design and analysis of NI trials with binomial proportions. We assessed 70 NI clinical trials, published between June 2017 and May 2018. Based on these trials, we outline the gaps in statistical reporting in the published articles, and provide recommendations to minimize the gaps. The recommendations, and the awareness they raise are a helpful addition to the efforts the research community is facing today in combating reproducibility and replicability issues.

Diversifying participation: The rarity of reporting racial demographics in neuroimaging research	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Neuroimaging; Diversity; Participant recruitment; Demographics	RACE	Functional neuroimaging has been instrumental to the field of cognitive neuroscience; however, its increasing prevalence has evoked conversations concerning limitations associated with reproducibility and bias. Prevailing racial, cultural, and socioeconomic biases in scientific research perpetuate demographic homogeneity in participation, contributing to failed replicability and generalizability and driving inaccurate representations of neurological normalcy. The current report employs systematic and exploratory search methods to investigate ongoing practices surrounding participant recruitment and documentation. The systematic search found that only 20 out of the 536 articles collected reported the race and ethnicity demographics of their participants, exposing a dearth of race and ethnicity demographics reporting in neuroimaging research. These results drive our recommendations for increased transparency and diversity surrounding research participation.

J	Helliwell, JR; Massera, C				Helliwell, John R.; Massera, Chiara			The four Rs and crystal structure analysis: reliability, reproducibility, replicability and reusability	JOURNAL OF APPLIED CRYSTALLOGRAPHY			English	Article						trust; reliability; reproducibility; replicability; reuse	X-RAY; PROTEIN; REFINEMENT; DIFFRACTION; PRECISION; ACCURACY; VALIDATION; CHEMISTRY; NMR	Within science, of which crystallography is a key part, there are questions posed to all fields that challenge the trust in results. The US National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine published a thorough report in 2019 on the Reproducibility and Replicability of Science: replicability being where a totally new study attempts to confirm if a phenomenon can be seen independently of another study. Data reuse is a key term in the FAIR data accord [Wilkinson et al. (2016). Sci. Data, 3, 160018], where the acronym FAIR means findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable. In the social sciences, the acronym FACT (namely fairness, accuracy, confidentiality and transparency) has emerged, the idea being that data should be FACTual to ensure trust [van der Aalst et al. (2017). Bus. Inf. Syst. Eng. 59, 311-313]. A distinction also must be made between accuracy and precision; indeed, the authors' lectures at the European Crystallography School ECS6 independently emphasized the need for use of other methods as well as crystal structure analysis to establish accuracy in biological and chemical/material functional contexts. The efforts by disparate science communities to introduce new terms to ensure trust have merit for discussion in crystallographic teaching commissions and possible adoption by crystallographers too.

Drawing on a representative sample of 40 x-phi studies published between 2003 and 2015, we enlisted 20 research teams across 8 countries to conduct a high-quality replication of each study in order to compare the results to the original published findings. We found that x-phi studies - as represented in our sample - successfully replicated about 70% of the time. We discuss possible reasons for this relatively high replication rate in the field of experimental philosophy and offer suggestions for best research practices going forward.

Prediction markets and related methods of eliciting peer beliefs are promising tools to predict replication outcomes. We invited researchers in the field of psychology to judge the replicability of 24 studies replicated in the large scale Many Labs 2 project. We elicited peer beliefs in prediction markets and surveys about two replication success metrics: the probability that the replication yields a statistically significant effect in the original direction (p < 0.001), and the relative effect size of the replication. The prediction markets correctly predicted 75% of the replication outcomes, and were highly correlated with the replication outcomes. Survey beliefs were also significantly correlated with replication outcomes, but had larger prediction errors. The prediction markets for relative effect sizes attracted little trading and thus did not work well. The survey beliefs about relative effect sizes performed better and were significantly correlated with observed relative effect sizes. The results suggest that replication outcomes can be predicted and that the elicitation of peer beliefs can increase our knowledge about scientific reproducibility and the dynamics of hypothesis testing.

To overcome these limitations, we have designed a data specification for ecological networks. We implemented a database respecting this standard, and released an R package (rmangal) allowing users to programmatically access, curate, and deposit data on ecological interactions. In this article, we show how these tools, in conjunction with other frameworks for the programmatic manipulation of open ecological data, streamlines the analysis process and improves replicability and reproducibility of ecological network studies.

Calculating detection limits and uncertainty of reference-based deconvolution of whole-blood DNA methylation data	EPIGENOMICS			English	Article						cellular deconvolution; DNA methylation; EWAS; in silico mixtures; limit of blank; limit of detection	EPIGENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION; PERFORMANCE; LANDSCAPE	DNA methylation (DNAm)-based cell mixture deconvolution (CMD) has become a quintessential part of epigenome-wide association studies where DNAm is profiled in heterogeneous tissue types. Despite being introduced over a decade ago, detection limits, which represent the smallest fraction of a cell type in a mixed biospecimen that can be reliably detected, have yet to be determined in the context of DNAm-based CMD. Moreover, there has been little attention given to approaches for quantifying the uncertainty associated with DNAm-based CMD. Here, analytical frameworks for determining both cell-specific limits of detection and quantification of uncertainty associated with DNAm-based CMD are described. This work may contribute to improved rigor, reproducibility and replicability of epigenome-wide association studies involving CMD.

Under the umbrella of the European project Eurobench, we collected approximately 30 protocols with related testbeds and scoring algorithms, aiming at characterizing the performances of humanoids, exoskeletons, and/or prosthesis under different conditions. The main challenge addressed in this study concerns the standardization of the scoring process to permit a systematic benchmark of the experiments. The complexity of this process is mainly due to the lack of consistency in how to store and organize experimental data, how to define the input and output of benchmarking algorithms, and how to implement these algorithms. We propose a simple but efficient methodology for preparing scoring algorithms, to ensure reproducibility and replicability of results. This methodology mainly constrains the interface of the software and enables the engineer to develop his/her metric in his/her favorite language. Continuous integration and deployment tools are then used to verify the replicability of the software and to generate an executable instance independent of the language through dockerization. This article presents this methodology and points at all the metrics and documentation repositories designed with this policy in Eurobench. Applying this approach to other protocols and metrics would ease the reproduction, replication, and comparison of experiments.

A collection of Data Descriptors published in Scientific Data presents data obtained in the process of attempting to replicate previously published research. These new replication data describe published and unpublished projects. The different papers in this collection highlight the many ways that scientific replications can be conducted, and they reveal the benefits and challenges of crucial replication research. The organizers of this collection encourage scientists to reuse the data contained in the collection for their own work, and also believe that these replication examples can serve as educational resources for students, early-career researchers, and experienced scientists alike who are interested in learning more about the process of replication.

In this article, we demonstrate a murine cryoinjury infarct model that generates precise infarct sizes with high reproducibility and replicability. In brief, after intubation and sternotomy of the animal, the heart is lifted from the thorax. The probe of a handheld liquid nitrogen delivery system is applied onto the myocardial wall to induce cryoinjury. Impaired ventricular function and electrical conduction can be monitored with echocardiography or optical mapping. Transmural myocardial remodeling of the infarcted area is characterized by collagen deposition and loss of cardiomyocytes. Compared to other models (e.g., LAD-ligation), this model utilizes a handheld liquid nitrogen delivery system to generate more uniform infarct sizes.

Given the benefits, the software engineering (SE) community has been diligently advocating open science policies during peer reviews and publication processes. However, to this date, there has been few studies that look into the status and issues of open science in SE from a systematic perspective. In this paper, we set out to start filling this gap. Given the great breadth of SE in general, we constrained our scope to a particular topic area in SE as an example case. Recently, an increasing number of deep learning (DL) approaches have been explored in SE, including DL-based software vulnerability detection, a popular, fast-growing topic that addresses an important problem in software security. We exhaustively searched the literature in this area and identified 55 relevant works that propose a DL-based vulnerability detection approach. This was then followed by comprehensively investigating the four integral aspects of open science: availability, executability, reproducibility, and replicability. Among other findings, our study revealed that only a small percentage (25.5%) of the studied approaches provided publicly available tools. Some of these available tools did not provide sufficient documentation and complete implementation, making them not executable or not reproducible. The uses of balanced or artificially generated datasets caused significantly overrated performance of the respective techniques, making most of them not replicable. Based on our empirical results, we made actionable suggestions on improving the state of open science in each of the four aspects. We note that our results and recommendations on most of these aspects (availability, executability, reproducibility) are not tied to the nature of the chosen topic (DL-based vulnerability detection) hence are likely applicable to other SE topic areas. We also believe our results and recommendations on replicability to be applicable to other DL-based topics in SE as they are not tied to (the particular application of DL in) detecting software vulnerabilities.

How to Improve the Reproducibility, Replicability, and Extensibility of Remote Sensing Research	REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						reproducibility; replicability; repeatability; benchmark data; provenance	SYSTEM	The field of remote sensing has undergone a remarkable shift where vast amounts of imagery are now readily available to researchers. New technologies, such as uncrewed aircraft systems, make it possible for anyone with a moderate budget to gather their own remotely sensed data, and methodological innovations have added flexibility for processing and analyzing data. These changes create both the opportunity and need to reproduce, replicate, and compare remote sensing methods and results across spatial contexts, measurement systems, and computational infrastructures. Reproducing and replicating research is key to understanding the credibility of studies and extending recent advances into new discoveries. However, reproducibility and replicability (R&R) remain issues in remote sensing because many studies cannot be independently recreated and validated. Enhancing the R&R of remote sensing research will require significant time and effort by the research community. However, making remote sensing research reproducible and replicable does not need to be a burden. In this paper, we discuss R&R in the context of remote sensing and link the recent changes in the field to key barriers hindering R&R while discussing how researchers can overcome those barriers. We argue for the development of two research streams in the field: (1) the coordinated execution of organized sequences of forward-looking replications, and (2) the introduction of benchmark datasets that can be used to test the replicability of results and methods.

As NIRS is a relatively recent brain imaging technique, the question of reproducibility has not yet been systematically addressed. Aim: The current study seeks to test the replicability of effects observed in NIRS experiments assessing young infants' rule-learning ability. Approach: We conducted meta-analyses and mixed-effects modeling-based inferential statistics to determine whether effect sizes were replicable and comparable in a sample of 23 NIRS studies investigating infants' abilities to process repetition- and diversity-based regularities in linguistic and nonlinguistic auditory and visual sequences. Additionally, we tested whether effect sizes were modulated by different factors such as the age of participants or the laboratory. We obtained NIRS data from 12 published and 11 unpublished studies. The 23 studies involved a total of 487 infants, aged between 0 and 9 months, tested in four different countries (Canada, France, Italy, and USA). Results: Our most important finding is that study and laboratory were never significant moderators of variation in effect sizes, indicating that results replicated reliably across the different studies and labs included in the sample. We observed small-to-moderate effect sizes, similar to effect sizes found with other neuroimaging and behavioral techniques in the developmental literature. In line with existing findings, effect sizes were modulated by the participants' age and differed across the different regularities tested, with repetition-based regularities giving rise to the strongest effects; in particular, the overall magnitude of this effect in the left temporal region was 0.27 when analyzing the entire dataset. Conclusions: Meta-analysis is a useful tool for assessing replicability and cross-study variability. Here, we have shown that infant NIRS studies in the language domain replicate robustly across various NIRS machines, testing sites, and developmental populations. (c) The Authors.

Objective: This study addresses the enhancement of the Rigor and Transparency Index (RTI, version 2.0), which attempts to automatically assess the rigor and transparency of journals, institutions, and countries using manuscripts scored on criteria found in reproducibility guidelines (eg, Materials Design, Analysis, and Reporting checklist criteria). Methods: The RTI tracks 27 entity types using natural language processing techniques such as Bidirectional Long Short-term Memory Conditional Random Field-based models and regular expressions; this allowed us to assess over 2 million papers accessed through PubMed Central. Results: Between 1997 and 2020 (where data were readily available in our data set), rigor and transparency measures showed general improvement (RTI 2.29 to 4.13), suggesting that authors are taking the need for improved reporting seriously. The top-scoring journals in 2020 were the Journal of Neurochemistry (6.23), British Journal of Pharmacology (6.07), and Nature Neuroscience (5.93). We extracted the institution and country of origin from the author affiliations to expand our analysis beyond journals. Among institutions publishing >1000 papers in 2020 (in the PubMed Central open access set), Capital Medical University (4.75), Yonsei University (4.58), and University of Copenhagen (4.53) were the top performers in terms of RTI. In country-level performance, we found that Ethiopia and Norway consistently topped the RTI charts of countries with 100 or more papers per year. In addition, we tested our assumption that the RTI may serve as a reliable proxy for scientific replicability (ie, a high RTI represents papers containing sufficient information for replication efforts). Using work by the Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology, we determined that replication papers (RTI 7.61, SD 0.78) scored significantly higher (P<.001) than the original papers (RTI 3.39, SD 1.12), which according to the project required additional information from authors to begin replication efforts. Conclusions: These results align with our view that RTI may serve as a reliable proxy for scientific replicability. Unfortunately, RTI measures for journals, institutions, and countries fall short of the replicated paper average. If we consider the RTI of these replication studies as a target for future manuscripts, more work will be needed to ensure that the average manuscript contains sufficient information for replication attempts.

Building theories of consistency and variability in children's language development: A large-scale data approach	ADVANCES IN CHILD DEVELOPMENT AND BEHAVIOR, VOL 61	Advances in Child Development and Behavior		English	Article; Book Chapter							INFANT-DIRECTED SPEECH; CROSS-LANGUAGE; PUBLICATION BIAS; SAMPLE-SIZE; PERCEPTION; PREFERENCE; LESSONS; POWER	Young children typically begin learning words during their first 2 years of life. On the other hand, they also vary substantially in their language learning. Similarities and differences in language learning call for a quantitative theory that can predict and explain which aspects of early language are consistent and which are variable. However, current developmental research practices limit our ability to build such quantitative theories because of small sample sizes and challenges related to reproducibility and replicability. In this chapter, we suggest that three approaches-meta-analysis, multi-site collaborations, and secondary data aggregation-can together address some of the limitations of current research in the developmental area. We review the strengths and limitations of each approach and end by discussing the potential impacts of combining these three approaches.

Personality predicts mortality risk: An integrative data analysis of 15 international longitudinal studies	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN PERSONALITY			English	Article						Personality; Mortality; Health behaviors; Replicability; Generalizability	ALL-CAUSE MORTALITY; COHORT PROFILE; COGNITIVE-ABILITIES; AGE; HEALTH; TEMPERAMENT; RELIABILITY; STABILITY; TRAITS; POWER	This study examined the Big Five personality traits as predictors of mortality risk, and smoking as a mediator of that association. Replication was built into the fabric of our design: we used a Coordinated Analysis with 15 international datasets, representing 44,094 participants. We found that high neuroticism and low conscientiousness, extraversion, and agreeableness were consistent predictors of mortality across studies. Smoking had a small mediating effect for neuroticism. Country and baseline age explained variation in effects: studies with older baseline age showed a pattern of protective effects (HR < 1.00) for openness, and U.S. studies showed a pattern of protective effects for extraversion. This study demonstrated coordinated analysis as a powerful approach to enhance replicability and reproducibility, especially for aging-related longitudinal research. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Within certain areas of preclinical research, there exists the tradition of repeating an experiment at least twice to demonstrate replicability. If the results of the first two experiments do not agree, then the experiment might be repeated a third time. Sometimes data of one representative experiment are shown; sometimes data from different experiments are pooled. However, there are hardly any guidelines about how to plan for such an experimental design or how to report the results obtained. This article provides a thorough statistical analysis of pre-planned experimental replications as they are currently often applied in practice and gives some recommendations about how to improve on study design and statistical analysis.

In this context, the present article justifies the importance of an economical and technologically simple process demonstrator. The construction of an experimental Thermo-Acoustic Refrigerator (TAR), employing an acoustic-to-thermal energy conversion cycle, is further described. Setup's repeatability and replicability and results' robustness were primarily addressed, while innovative techniques for stack production and optimization were also proposed. The success of experiments in terms of optimization and reproducibility was validated via the temperature gradients obtained. The adequacy of experimental results was verified by comparing them with a numerical simulation using the DeltaEC software.

Evaluation of reproducible and transparent research practices in pulmonology	PULMONOLOGY			English	Article						Reproducibility of results; Evidence-based medicine; Pulmonology	REPORTING GUIDELINES; TRIAL REGISTRATION; RELIABILITY	Background: Study reproducibility is valuable for validating or refuting results. Provision of reproducibility indicators, such as materials, protocols, and raw data in a study improve its potential for reproduction. Efforts to reproduce noteworthy studies in the biomedical sciences have resulted in an overwhelming majority of them being found to be unreplicable, causing concern for the integrity of research in other fields, including medical specialties. Here, we analyzed the reproducibility of studies in the field of pulmonology. Methods: 500 pulmonology articles were randomly selected from an initial PubMed search for data extraction. Two authors scoured these articles for reproducibility indicators including materials, protocols, raw data, analysis scripts, inclusion in systematic reviews, and citations by replication studies as well as other factors of research transparency including open accessibility, funding source and competing interest disclosures, and study preregistration. Findings: Few publications included statements regarding materials (10%), protocols (1%), data (15%), and analysis script (0%) availability. Less than 10% indicated preregistration. More than half of the publications analyzed failed to provide a funding statement. Conversely, 63% of the publications were open access and 73% included a conflict of interest statement. Interpretation: Overall, our study indicates pulmonology research is currently lacking in efforts to increase replicability. Future studies should focus on providing sufficient information regarding materials, protocols, raw data, and analysis scripts, among other indicators, for the sake of clinical decisions that depend on replicable or refutable results from the primary literature.

Optimization of cell viability assays to improve replicability and reproducibility of cancer drug sensitivity screens	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							CLINICAL PHARMACOKINETICS; VARIABILITY; RATES; LINES	Cancer drug development has been riddled with high attrition rates, in part, due to poor reproducibility of preclinical models for drug discovery. Poor experimental design and lack of scientific transparency may cause experimental biases that in turn affect data quality, robustness and reproducibility. Here, we pinpoint sources of experimental variability in conventional 2D cell-based cancer drug screens to determine the effect of confounders on cell viability for MCF7 and HCC38 breast cancer cell lines treated with platinum agents (cisplatin and carboplatin) and a proteasome inhibitor (bortezomib). Variance component analysis demonstrated that variations in cell viability were primarily associated with the choice of pharmaceutical drug and cell line, and less likely to be due to the type of growth medium or assay incubation time. Furthermore, careful consideration should be given to different methods of storing diluted pharmaceutical drugs and use of DMSO controls due to the potential risk of evaporation and the subsequent effect on dose-response curves. Optimization of experimental parameters not only improved data quality substantially but also resulted in reproducible results for bortezomib- and cisplatin-treated HCC38, MCF7, MCF-10A, and MDA-MB-436 cells. Taken together, these findings indicate that replicability (the same analyst re-performs the same experiment multiple times) and reproducibility (different analysts perform the same experiment using different experimental conditions) for cell-based drug screens can be improved by identifying potential confounders and subsequent optimization of experimental parameters for each cell line.

To solidify these reforms within the scientific community, student courses on open science practices are essential. Here we describe the content of our Research Master course "Good Research Practices" which we have designed and taught at the University of Amsterdam. Supported by Chambers' recent book The 7 Deadly Sins of Psychology, the course covered topics such as QRPs, the importance of direct and conceptual replication studies, preregistration, and the public sharing of data, code, and analysis plans. We adopted a pedagogical approach that: (a) reduced teacher-centered lectures to a minimum; (b) emphasized practical training on open science practices; and (c) encouraged students to engage in the ongoing discussions in the open science community on social media platforms.

Replicability of time-varying connectivity patterns in large resting state fMRI samples	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Dynamic functional connectivity; Sliding window method; Replicability; Hard clustering; Fuzzy meta-state; Surrogate testing	DYNAMIC FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; BRAIN CONNECTIVITY; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL SIGNATURES; SPONTANEOUS FLUCTUATIONS; NETWORK; CORTEX; SERIES; CONSCIOUSNESS; CONNECTOMICS	The past few years have seen an emergence of approaches that leverage temporal changes in whole-brain patterns of functional connectivity (the chronnectome). In this chronnectome study, we investigate the replicability of the human brain's inter-regional coupling dynamics during rest by evaluating two different dynamic functional network connectivity (dFNC) analysis frameworks using 7 500 functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) datasets. To quantify the extent to which the emergent functional connectivity (FC) patterns are reproducible, we characterize the temporal dynamics by deriving several summary measures across multiple large, independent age-matched samples. Reproducibility was demonstrated through the existence of basic connectivity patterns (FC states) amidst an ensemble of inter-regional connections. Furthermore, application of the methods to conservatively configured (statistically stationary, linear and Gaussian) surrogate datasets revealed that some of the studied state summary measures were indeed statistically significant and also suggested that this class of null model did not explain the fMRI data fully. This extensive testing of reproducibility of similarity statistics also suggests that the estimated FC states are robust against variation in data quality, analysis, grouping, and decomposition methods. We conclude that future investigations probing the functional and neurophysiological relevance of time-varying connectivity assume critical importance.

J	Caset, F; Derudder, B; Van Migerode, C; De Wit, B				Caset, Freke; Derudder, Ben; Van Migerode, Celine; De Wit, Bart			Mapping the Spatial Conditions of Polycentric Urban Development in Europe: An Open-source Software Tool	GEOGRAPHICAL ANALYSIS			English	Article							FUNCTIONAL POLYCENTRICITY; REGION; PRODUCTIVITY; CHINA	Urban polycentricity has become a key concept in urban and regional studies and is increasingly adopted as an organizational framework for conducting empirical research. Within this literature, polycentric urban regions are commonly defined as territories that have multiple, proximately located (sub)centers and are characterized by balanced urban development. However, analytical-operational frameworks to identify and classify PURs are often ad hoc efforts to answer a specific research question and underlying work is often shelved rather than shared and/or made accessible. As a result, challenges associated with generalizability, reproducibility, and replicability clearly loom large in the urban polycentricity literature. Against this backdrop, this article describes the discrepancy between a rich debate on polycentricity and the paucity of tools enabling the disambiguation and reproducibility of results claimed by various authors around this polysemic concept. We present an online and open tool-PURban-that brings together the major analytical-operational frameworks and data sets in urban polycentricity research and allows parametrizing key operational choices. To illustrate the tool, we demonstrate how it facilitates the identification, mapping and analysis of degrees of morphological polycentricity in European urban systems. We conclude by reflecting on how this tool can act as a catalyst for future research on urban polycentricity.

To address this need, the FORCE11 Software Citation Implementation Working Group convened a Task Force to distill the experiences of the managers of existing resources in setting expectations for all stakeholders. In this article, we describe the resultant best practices which include defining the scope, policies, and rules that govern individual registries and repositories, along with the background, examples, and collaborative work that went into their development.

Contrast coding choices in a decade of mixed models	JOURNAL OF MEMORY AND LANGUAGE			English	Article						Contrasts; Meta-science; Mixed effect models; Replication crisis		Contrast coding in regression models, including mixed-effect models, changes what the terms in the model mean. In particular, it determines whether or not model terms should be interpreted as main effects. This paper highlights how opaque descriptions of contrast coding have affected the field of psycholinguistics. We begin with a reproducible example in R using simulated data to demonstrate how incorrect conclusions can be made from mixed models; this also serves as a primer on contrast coding for statistical novices. We then present an analysis of 3384 papers from the field of psycholinguistics that we coded based upon whether a clear description of contrast coding was present. This analysis demonstrates that the majority of the psycholinguistic literature does not transparently describe contrast coding choices, posing an important challenge to reproducibility and replicability in our field.

In order to analyze the between researcher variability in data analysis choices as well as the aspects within the data analysis pipeline that contribute to the variability in results, we have created two R packages: matahari and tidycode. These packages build on methods created for natural language processing; rather than allowing for the processing of natural language, we focus on R code as the substrate of interest. The matahari package facilitates the logging of everything that is typed in the R console or in an R script in a tidy data frame. The tidycode package contains tools to allow for analyzing R calls in a tidy manner. We demonstrate the utility of these packages as well as walk through two examples.

Replicability and Reproducibility in Comparative Psychology	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						animal research; comparative psychology; pre-registration; replication; reproducible research	NULL-HYPOTHESIS; REPLICATION; BIAS; RELIABILITY; EVOLUTION; THINKING; FAILURE; SNARK; LABS	Psychology faces a replication crisis. The Reproducibility Project: Psychology sought to replicate the effects of 100 psychology studies. Though 97% of the original studies produced statistically significant results, only 36% of the replication studies did so (Open Science Collaboration, 2015). This inability to replicate previously published results, however, is not limited to psychology (Ioannidis, 2005). Replication projects in medicine (Prinz et al., 2011) and behavioral economics (Camerer et al., 2016) resulted in replication rates of 25 and 61%, respectively, and analyses in genetics (Munafo, 2009) and neuroscience (Button et al., 2013) question the validity of studies in those fields. Science, in general, is reckoning with challenges in one of its basic tenets: replication. Comparative psychology also faces the grand challenge of producing replicable research. Though social psychology has born the brunt of most of the critique regarding failed replications, comparative psychology suffers from some of the same problems faced by social psychology (e.g., small sample sizes). Yet, comparative psychology follows the methods of cognitive psychology by often using within-subjects designs, which may buffer it from replicability problems (Open Science Collaboration, 2015). In this Grand Challenge article, I explore the shared and unique challenges of and potential solutions for replication and reproducibility in comparative psychology.

FDOPA PET Imaging Working Grp	An automatic analysis framework for FDOPA PET neuroimaging	JOURNAL OF CEREBRAL BLOOD FLOW AND METABOLISM			English	Article						FDOPA PET; dopamine synthesis; data analysis pipeline; neuroimaging biomarker; big data repository	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; DOPAMINE SYNTHESIS CAPACITY; BRAIN TRANSFER CONSTANTS; GENDER-DIFFERENCES; GRAPHICAL EVALUATION; SCHIZOPHRENIA; PSYCHOSIS; INHIBITION; STRIATUM; RELEASE	In this study we evaluate the performance of a fully automated analytical framework for FDOPA PET neuroimaging data, and its sensitivity to demographic and experimental variables and processing parameters. An instance of XNAT imaging platform was used to store the King's College London institutional brain FDOPA PET imaging archive, alongside individual demographics and clinical information. By re-engineering the historical Matlab-based scripts for FDOPA PET analysis, a fully automated analysis pipeline for imaging processing and data quantification was implemented in Python and integrated in XNAT. The final data repository includes 892 FDOPA PET scans organized from 23 different studies. We found good reproducibility of the data analysis by the automated pipeline (in the striatum for the Ki(cer): for the controls ICC = 0.71, for the psychotic patients ICC = 0.88). From the demographic and experimental variables assessed, gender was found to most influence striatal dopamine synthesis capacity (F = 10.7, p < 0.001), with women showing greater dopamine synthesis capacity than men. Our automated analysis pipeline represents a valid resourse for standardised and robust quantification of dopamine synthesis capacity using FDOPA PET data. Combining information from different neuroimaging studies has allowed us to test it comprehensively and to validate its replicability and reproducibility performances on a large sample size.

Although often discussed separately, these five challenges may share a common cause: insufficient investment of intellectual and nonintellectual resources into the typical psychology study. We suggest that the emerging emphasis on big-team science can help address these challenges by allowing researchers to pool their resources together to increase the amount available for a single study. However, the current incentives, infrastructure, and institutions in academic science have all developed under the assumption that science is conducted by solo principal investigators and their dependent trainees, an assumption that creates barriers to sustainable big-team science. We also anticipate that big-team science carries unique risks, such as the potential for big-team-science organizations to be co-opted by unaccountable leaders, become overly conservative, and make mistakes at a grand scale. Big-team-science organizations must also acquire personnel who are properly compensated and have clear roles. Not doing so raises risks related to mismanagement and a lack of financial sustainability. If researchers can manage its unique barriers and risks, big-team science has the potential to spur great progress in psychology and beyond.

However, in previous studies of the general population, investigations of the cognitive mechanisms underlying hallucinatory experiences have yielded inconsistent results. We ran a large-scale preregistered multisite study, in which general-population participants (N = 1,394 across 11 data-collection sites and online) completed assessments of hallucinatory experiences, a measure of adverse childhood experiences, and four tasks: source memory, dichotic listening, backward digit span, and auditory signal detection. We found that hallucinatory experiences were associated with a higher false-alarm rate on the signal detection task and a greater number of reported adverse childhood experiences but not with any of the other cognitive measures employed. These findings are an important step in improving reproducibility in hallucinations research and suggest that the replicability of some findings regarding cognition in clinical samples needs to be investigated.

Unfortunately, these discussions have been plagued by a set of at least 3 interrelated problems: A lack of conceptual clarity when defining open science-related challenges to communication scholarship; the irony of using intuition rather than evidence when trying to improve communication science; and our field's surprising lack of attention to nonreplicability in social media data as one of our field's most rapidly growing data sources.

MethodsThe evaluation of tumor budding was performed by three examiners in 103 samples of OSCC, using the two methods. A Likert-type scale was used to measure the difficulty in the assessment. The interexaminer agreement (reproducibility) was estimated using Fleiss's kappa and the intra-examiner agreement (repeatability) was estimated using Cohen's kappa. The agreement between the two methods was evaluated using Cohen's Kappa. The Friedman test was used to compare the three examiners' perceived levels of difficulty of assessment. The Wilcoxon test was used to compare the level of difficulty of the evaluation between the two methods. ResultsReproducibility by the immunostaining method for multicytokeratin was substantial, being higher than the only fair agreement by the HE. Repeatability by the HE ranged from moderate to substantial among examiners, regardless of the examiner's experience. Repeatability by the immunostaining method for multicytokeratin did not vary among examiners, showing almost perfect agreement. The agreement between the two methods ranged from fair to moderate among examiners, being lower in the less experienced examiner. All the examiners presented greater difficulty in the evaluation by the HE. ConclusionIn view of the unsatisfactory agreement between the two methods of tumor budding evaluation in OSCC, it is recommended that this evaluation should be performed by the immunostaining method for multicytokeratin, considering its higher reproducibility, greater replicability, and lower difficulty compared to the HE.

INFRAFRONTIER, the European Research Infrastructure for the generation, phenotyping, archiving, and distribution of model mammalian genomes, is addressing this issue by developing internal quality principles for its different service areas, that provides a quality framework for its operational activities. This article introduces the INFRAFRONTIER Quality Principles in Systemic Phenotyping of genetically altered mouse models. A total of 11 key principles are included, ranging from general requirements for compliance with guidelines on animal testing, to the need for well-trained personnel and more specific standards such as the exchange of reference lines. Recently established requirements such as the provision of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) data are also addressed. For each quality principle, we have outlined the specific context, requirements, further recommendations, and key references.

However, the development of research processes and tools did not keep pace with the rapid advancement of the disciplines, resulting in several insufficiently tackled challenges to attain reproducibility, replicability, and comparability of achieved results. In this discussion paper, we review existing tools, platforms and standardization efforts for addressing these challenges. As a common ground for our analysis, we develop an open science centred process model for machine learning research, which combines openness and transparency with the core processes of machine learning and data science. Based on the features of over 40 tools, platforms and standards, we list the, in our opinion, 11 most central platforms for the research process in this paper. We conclude that most platforms cover only parts of the requirements for overcoming the identified challenges.

While the ASA Statement notes that statistical significance and p-values are commonly misused and misinterpreted, it does not discuss and document broader implications of these errors for the interpretation of evidence. In this article, we review research on how applied researchers who are not primarily statisticians misuse and misinterpret p-values in practice and how this can lead to errors in the interpretation of evidence. We also present new data showing, perhaps surprisingly, that researchers who are primarily statisticians are also prone to misusei and misinterpret, p-values thus resulting in similar errors. In particular, we show that statisticians tend to interpret evidence dichotomously based on whether or not a p-value crosses the conventional 0.05 threshold for statistical significance, We discuss implications and offer recommendations.

This methodology paper consists of five sections discussing the definitions of replicability, reproducibility, and reproducible research, the current status of reproducible research in nursing science, the introduction of a reproducible framework, and the challenges and recommendations for reproducible research. To ensure the data preprocessing process and data analysis of an original study at the minimum standard, it is necessary for the study's data investigative cycle to be transparent. Most arguments for reproducible research were driven by a critical review of journal articles and conference proceedings. The suggested methodological framework capturing how scientific research generates is expected to contribute to guiding nurse scientists to conduct reproducible research. To generate high-quality scientific evidence for evidence-based practice, the reproducible framework should be integrated into nursing research.

However, recent reviews of this body of literature have commented adversely on the overall quality of the research, highlighting problems with the pictogram design process, as well as calling for improvement in both the methodology and reporting of all aspects of designing, developing, modifying, evaluating and applying pictograms in practice. The heterogeneity in study design, as well as in the interventions and outcomes measured, prevents overall conclusions being drawn about the effectiveness of pictograms on comprehension and medicine-taking behaviour such as adherence and self-care. The reporting of such research should provide adequate detail to enable reproducibility and replicability of the research. This article offers guidance in designing and reporting pictogram-based research, highlighting areas that are often problematic or inadequately addressed.

HARKing and P-Hacking: A Call for More Transparent Reporting of Studies in the Information Systems Field	COMMUNICATIONS OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						p-Hacking; HARKing; Transparent Reporting; Questionable Research Practices; Selective Reporting	PREREGISTRATION; IMPROVE	While researchers are expected to look for significant results to confirm their hypotheses, some engage in intentional or unintentional HARKing (Hypothesizing After Results are Known) and p-hacking (repeated tinkering with data and retesting). If these practices are widespread, one possible result is field-wide exaggerated (inflated) results reported in Information Systems (IS) publications. In this paper, we summarize the literature on HARKing and p-hacking across different disciplines. We offer an illustrative example of how an IS study could involve HARKing and p-hacking in various stages of the project to generate a more "publishable" result. We also report on a survey targeted at IS researchers to explore their experiences and awareness of this issue. Finally, we provide recommendations and suggestions based on the review of practices in other fields and advocate for more transparency in reporting research projects, so that study results can be interpreted properly, and reproducibility and replicability can be increased.

Methods: The EESC was applied to parents of children with and without ADHD. The children were divided into age groups: Group A, between six and eight years old; Group B, between nine and 11 years old; and Group C, between 12 and 15 years old. The validation was carried out according to the steps proposed by Guillemin et al. For the statistical calculation, Cronbach's alpha, Pearson's correlation, the ICC and ROC curve were used. Results: The statistical tests showed satisfactory coefficients: Cronbach's alpha = 0.76; Pearson's correlation r = 0.91 with CI 95%; replicability ICC = 0.66; sensitivity 0.75; specificity 0.67; accuracy 71%. Conclusion: According to psychometric data on internal and external consistency (reliability, reproducibility), sensitivity, and specificity, the parent-rated EESC for ADHD is useful in assessing emotional expression.

Here we summarize recommendations for such practices in magnetoencephalographic (MEG) and electroencephalographic (EEG) research, recently developed by the OHBM neuroimaging community known by the abbreviated name of COBIDAS MEEG. We discuss the rationale for the guidelines and their general content, which encompass many topics under active discussion in the field. We highlight future opportunities and challenges to maximizing the sharing and exploitation of MEG and EEG data, and we also discuss how this 'living' set of guidelines will evolve to continually address new developments in neurophysiological assessment methods and multimodal integration of neurophysiological data with other data types. The Organization for Human Brain Mapping presents its best practices report for reproducible EEG and MEG research, highlighting issues and main recommendations in this Perspective.

The scope and depth of such evaluations are unfortunately hard to improve, due to the limitations by the set-up costs, logistics, and organization complexity of large events. We show that this easily impairs the statistical significance of the collected results, and the reproducibility of the competition outcomes. In this article, we present a methodology for remote comparative evaluations of content-based video retrieval systems and demonstrate that such evaluations scale-up to sizes that reliably produce statistically robust results, and propose additional measures that increase the replicability of the experiment. The proposed remote evaluation methodology forms a major contribution toward open science in interactive retrieval benchmarks. At the same time, the detailed evaluation reports form an interesting source of new observations about many subtle, previously inaccessible aspects of video retrieval.

Topics of R&R have sailed to the forefront of research agenda in many fields recently but have received less attention in remote sensing in general and specifically for studies utilizing hyperspectral data. Given the extremely local environments in which many hyperspectral studies are conducted (e.g., agricultural field plots), purposeful attention to the repeatability of findings across study locales can help ensure methods are generalizable. This study undertakes an investigation of the nutrient content of tef (Eragrostis tef), an understudied plant that is growing in importance due to both food and forage benefits, but does so within the context of the replicability of methods and findings across two study sites situated in different international and environmental contexts. The aims are to (1) determine whether calcium, magnesium, and protein of both the plant and grain can be predicted using hyperspectral data with partial least squares (PLS) regression with waveband selection, and (2) compare the replicability of models across differing environments. Results suggest the method can produce high nutrient prediction accuracy for both the plant and grain in individual environments, but selection of wavebands for nutrient prediction was not comparable across study areas. The findings suggest that the method must be calibrated in each location, thereby reducing the potential to extrapolate methods to different areas. Our findings highlight the need for greater attention to methods and results replication in remote sensing, specifically hyperspectral analyses, in order for scientific findings to be repeatable beyond the plot level.

Inmost current analysis protocols, cell type-based cluster annotation is manually performed and heavily relies on prior knowledge, resulting in poor replicability of cell type annotation. This study aimed to introduce a single-cell Cluster-based Automatic Annotation Toolkit for Cellular Heterogeneity (scCATCH, https://github.com/ZJUFanLab/scCATCH). Using three benchmark datasets, the feasibility of evidence-based scoring and tissue-specific cellular annotation strategies were demonstrated by high concordance among cell types, and scCATCH outperformed Seurat, a popular method for marker genes identification, and cell-based annotation methods. Furthermore, scCATCH accurately annotated 67%-100% (average, 83%) clusters in six published scRNA-seq datasets originating from various tissues. The present results show that scCATCH accurately revealed cell identities with high reproducibility, thus potentially providing insights into mechanisms underlying disease pathogenesis and progression.

The study is based on the review of the current literature. Three central issues are highlighted: a) the scarcity of replication attempts is caused by the incentive structure faced by management scholars, b) since the majority of published replications (interstudy and intrastudy) are authored by the researchers who conducted the original study, their results can be affected by the same incentives that affect the results of the original study, c) the popularity of research findings seems to be unaffected by failed attempts to reproduce them. This introductory treatment of the issue suggests that further examination of the relationship between the authorship and replication results is warranted. Increasing the number of replication studies requires a significant change in the incentive structure to which scholars are exposed.

HYPOTHESIS-DRIVEN SIMULATION EXPERIMENTS WITH AN EXTENSION TO SED-ML	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SIMULATION MODELLING			English	Article						Design of Experiments; Simulation Experiment Description Markup Language; Global Model Management; Signal Temporal Logic	GUIDELINES; MODEL	Most of the frameworks or assistance systems for experiment specification do not provide a process explicitly based on formally specified hypotheses. This deficiency leads to inaccurate or insufficient record of an experiment, decreasing the trustworthiness and reproducibility of the experiment. Moreover, the wide variety of models, metamodels, tools, and data for experimentation requires Global Model Management (GMM) that is utilizing Model-Driven Engineering techniques, facilitates documentation, sharing, reusability, and replicability of simulation experiments. In this study, we strive to illustrate how to support simulation experimentation with hypotheses as a scientific workflow through GMM with an extension to the Simulation Experiment Description Mark-up Language (SED-ML). In particular, we present a megamodel built to serve as a repository to manage the artefacts employed in a simulation experiment. Based on the SED-ML, and enriched with hypothesis handling, our megamodel attempts to address all the phases of a simulation experiment, including specification, input data generation, execution, and output data analysis.

Reproducible Analyses in Education Research	QUALITY OF RESEARCH EVIDENCE IN EDUCATION: HOW DO WE KNOW?	Review of Research in Education		English	Article; Book Chapter							REPLICATION; SCIENCE; QUALITY; BIAS	A reproducible analysis is one in which an independent entity, using the same data and the same statistical code, would obtain the exact same result as the previous analyst. Reproducible analyses utilize script-based analyses and open data to aid in the reproduction of the analysis. A reproducible analysis does not ensure the same results are obtained if another sample of data is obtained, often referred to as replicability. Reproduction and replication of studies are discussed as well as the overwhelming benefits of creating a reproducible analysis workflow. A tool is proposed to aid in the evaluation of studies to describe which element in a study has a strong reproducible workflow and areas that could be improved. This tool is meant to serve as a discussion tool, not to rank studies or devalue studies that are unable to share data or statistical code. Finally, discussion surrounding reproducibility for qualitative studies are discussed along with unique challenges for adopting a reproducible analysis framework.

These critiques as well as failures to replicate several high-profile studies have been used as justification to proclaim a replication crisis in psychology. Psychologists are encouraged to conduct more exact replications of published studies to assess the reproducibility of psychological research. This article argues that the alleged crisis of replicability is primarily due to an epistemological misunderstanding that emphasizes the phenomenon instead of its underlying mechanisms. As a consequence, a replicated phenomenon may not serve as a rigorous test of a theoretical hypothesis because identical operationalizations of variables in studies conducted at different times and with different subject populations might test different theoretical constructs. Therefore, we propose that for meaningful replications, attempts at reinstating the original circumstances are not sufficient. Instead, replicators must ascertain that conditions are realized that reflect the theoretical variable(s) manipulated (and/or measured) in the original study.

Sample sizes for replication studies are often calculated using conditional power based on the effect estimate from the original study. However, this approach is not well suited as it ignores the uncertainty of the original result. Bayesian methods are used in clinical trials to incorporate prior information into power calculations. We propose to adapt this methodology to the replication framework and promote the use of predictive instead of conditional power in the design of replication studies. Moreover, we describe how extensions of the methodology to sequential clinical trials can be tailored to replication studies. Conditional and predictive power calculated at an interim analysis are compared and we argue that predictive power is a useful tool to decide whether to stop a replication study prematurely. A recent project on the replicability of social sciences is used to illustrate the properties of the different methods.

However, the variability in protocols and reporting in nanoscience represents a barrier to advances in new therapies. Recent literature has highlighted the challenge of reproducibility in biomedical research. In this study involving three researchers performing the experiments we therefore verified the repeatability and replicability of PLGA nanoparticles fabricated by the emulsion solvent evaporation method. Furthermore, we investigated how variables during synthesis, isolation, and characterisation of PLGA particles affect the reported particle size and drug encapsulation. Synthesis parameters including emulsification technique, type of polymer, and type of surfactant were investigated. In the isolation process, we tested the effect of washing and filtration. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) was used to determine the number weighted mean, z-average, and polydispersity index (PDI). Direct visualization of the particles was achieved by scanning and transmission electron microscopies. Changes in the source of energy input to the system using a sonic probe and homogeniser showed the most pronounced effect on particle size and PDI. This work has demonstrated that particle properties are affected by multiple variables involved in the synthesis and isolation processes. We provided advice for PLGA-based nanoparticle fabrication and drug encapsulation quantification as well as the minimum required information to be reported allowing reproducibility.

Deep learning for automatic brain tumour segmentation on MRI: evaluation of recommended reporting criteria via a reproduction and replication study	BMJ OPEN			English	Article						magnetic resonance imaging; diagnostic radiology; neuroradiology; statistics & research methods		Objectives To determine the reproducibility and replicability of studies that develop and validate segmentation methods for brain tumours on MRI and that follow established reproducibility criteria; and to evaluate whether the reporting guidelines are sufficient. Methods Two eligible validation studies of distinct deep learning (DL) methods were identified. We implemented the methods using published information and retraced the reported validation steps. We evaluated to what extent the description of the methods enabled reproduction of the results. We further attempted to replicate reported findings on a clinical set of images acquired at our institute consisting of high-grade and low-grade glioma (HGG, LGG), and meningioma (MNG) cases. Results We successfully reproduced one of the two tumour segmentation methods. Insufficient description of the preprocessing pipeline and our inability to replicate the pipeline resulted in failure to reproduce the second method. The replication of the first method showed promising results in terms of Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and sensitivity (Sen) on HGG cases (DSC=0.77, Sen=0.88) and LGG cases (DSC=0.73, Sen=0.83), however, poorer performance was observed for MNG cases (DSC=0.61, Sen=0.71). Preprocessing errors were identified that contributed to low quantitative scores in some cases. Conclusions Established reproducibility criteria do not sufficiently emphasise description of the preprocessing pipeline. Discrepancies in preprocessing as a result of insufficient reporting are likely to influence segmentation outcomes and hinder clinical utilisation. A detailed description of the whole processing chain, including preprocessing, is thus necessary to obtain stronger evidence of the generalisability of DL-based brain tumour segmentation methods and to facilitate translation of the methods into clinical practice.

The MATLAB Arduino package suffers from serious timing jitter during real-time data acquisition. This timing jitter associated with four main commands (analog read, digital read, digital write, and PWM set) available in MATLAB Arduino package is statistically analyzed, and a simple post-hoc timing jitter correction mechanism is proposed to acquire data points with high timing accuracy. The benchmark of the final program is conducted at various sampling rates for multichannel acquisition with 10 Hz comes as the maximum sampling rate for 5 channel recording. In the end, a use case of the developed tool for physiological data acquisition in multimodal biofeedback is presented. The software tool, data, and analysis scripts that support the findings of this study are released as an open-source project to support the replicability and reproducibility of the research.

We focus on high-throughput studies where a large number of biomarkers is measured in a training study, but only a subset of the most significant findings is selected and re-tested in a validation study. Our aim is to get the statistical measures of overall assessment for the selected markers, by integrating the information in both the training and validation studies. Naive statistical measures, such as the combined P$$ P $$-value by conventional meta-analysis, that ignore the non-random selection are clearly biased, producing over-optimistic significance. We use the false-discovery rate (FDR) concept to develop a selection-adjusted FDR (sFDR) as an overall assessment measure. We describe the link between the overall assessment and other concepts such as replicability and meta-analysis. Some simulation studies and two real metabolomic datasets are considered to illustrate the application of sFDR in high-throughput data analyses.

J	Karakanta, M				Karakanta, Mina			Experimental research in automatic subtitling At the crossroads between machine translation and audiovisual translation	TRANSLATION SPACES			English	Article						Subtitling; Neural Machine Translation; speech translation; evaluation; post-editing		Recent developments in neural machine translation, and especially speech translation, are gradually but firmly entering the field of audiovisual translation (AVT). Automation in subtitling is extending from a machine translation (MT) component to fully automatic subtitling, which comprises MT, auto-spotting and automatic segmentation. The rise of this new paradigm renders MT-oriented experimental designs inadequate for the evaluation and investigation of automatic subtitling, since they fail to encompass the multimodal nature and technical requirements of subtitling. This paper highlights the methodological gaps to be addressed by multidisciplinary efforts in order to overcome these inadequacies and obtain metrics and methods that lead to rigorous experimental research in automatic subtitling. It presents a review of previous experimental designs in MT for subtitling, identifies their limitations for conducting research under the new paradigm and proposes a set of recommendations towards achieving replicability and reproducibility in experimental research at the crossroads between AVT and MT.

J	Yurgeneva, AL				Yurgeneva, Alexandra L.			Replicability in Art Photography: From Pictorialism to NFT Art	NAUKA TELEVIDENIYA-THE ART AND SCIENCE OF TELEVISION			Russian	Article						blockchain; art photography; NFT; copyright; art market; replicability		The article deals with the idea of uniqueness as an obligatory feature of a work of art in relation to artistic photography. The work is of an overview nature, it notes the methods of giving photographs the features of originality, which emerged at different stages during the century-long history of artistic photography. Earlier studies never focused on the fact that photographers were constantly artificially limiting the technical reproducibility of their works. Addressing this issue defines the novelty of this work. Such a limitation was demanded by an approach in which photographic images had been evaluated from the perspective of traditional art, which affected not only determination of their aesthetic value, but also the legal aspect. And yet, at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries, the presence of machine nature in photography became a stumbling block in the development of legislative norms on the copyright for pictorialists. The entry of photography into the art market environment gave it the obligation to limit the number of copies based on commercial considerations. The relevance of the study lies in the issues of replicability in digital art, its acquisition and sale. I attempt to interpret the phenomenon of the blockchain system as a concept influencing new ways of understanding and evaluating digital photography in light of its history. The emergence of the NFT format is considered as a moment of overcoming the attitude towards the replicability of artistic photography as a problem rather than its natural property. A suggestion is made that the emergence of a virtual artistic environment has the potential to harmonize this long-standing conflict, and also raises the question of the need for new legal norms in this area.

J	Helliwell, JR				Helliwell, John R.			Raw diffraction data are our ground truth from which all subsequent workflows develop	ACTA CRYSTALLOGRAPHICA SECTION D-STRUCTURAL BIOLOGY			English	Article						raw diffraction data; workflows; FACT and FAIR; versions of record	REFINEMENT; PRECISION; SOFTWARE; METADATA; TOOLS	Defining best practice in science is challenging. International consensus is facilitated by the International Science Council via its members such as the International Union of Crystallography (IUCr). The crystallographic community has many decades of tradition linking articles with the underpinning data, and is admired across all sciences accordingly. Crystallography has always been at the forefront of harnessing new technology in the service of consensus. Technology has provided new vast data-archiving opportunities, allowing the preservation of raw diffraction data, along with article and database depositions of a model's coordinates and associated structure factors. The raw diffraction data, which can now be preserved, are the ground truth from which all subsequent workflows develop. Journal editorial boards provide a practical forum for setting the criteria to decide if a study's files are truly the version of record. Within that, reality involves a variance of reasonable workflows. But what is a reasonable variance? Workflows must be detailed carefully by authors in explaining what they have done. There is a great, and increasing, diversity of macromolecular crystallography analyses, and yet an increased constraint on how much can be written in an article about the workflow used. Raw data provide the ultimate reproducibility evidence. A part of reproducibility and replicability is using an agreed vocabulary; the meaning of words such as precision and accuracy and, more recently, the confidence of a protein structure prediction should feature in approaching 'truth'.

A number of large-scale replication projects have been conducted to gauge the overall reproducibility in specific academic fields. Here, we present an analysis of data from four studies which sought to forecast the outcomes of replication projects in the social and behavioural sciences, using human experts who participated in prediction markets and answered surveys. Because the number of findings replicated and predicted in each individual study was small, pooling the data offers an opportunity to evaluate hypotheses regarding the performance of prediction markets and surveys at a higher power. In total, peer beliefs were elicited for the replication outcomes of 103 published findings. We find there is information within the scientific community about the replicability of scientific findings, and that both surveys and prediction markets can be used to elicit and aggregate this information. Our results show prediction markets can determine the outcomes of direct replications with 73% accuracy (n = 103). Both the prediction market prices, and the average survey responses are correlated with outcomes (0.581 and 0.564 respectively, both p < .001). We also found a significant relationship between p-values of the original findings and replication outcomes.

To raise awareness about such threats, we present the results of a case study involving a low-cost spy camera glasses device, readily available on the market, that can be used to record and stream live video, for which we demonstrate infringement of several privacy requirements (regarding the camera glasses device itself, the data collected by the embedded video camera, the wearer of the device, and for bystanders as well) that lead to corresponding security threats (e.g., data confidentiality, integrity, availability, and access control). To foster replicability and reproducibility of our empirical results, investigation method, and implementation of attacks, we describe our case study in the form of a detailed activity log and release full C++ code implementing our approach. Furthermore, we present our findings to three IT security experts and summarize their recommendations for designing more secure connected camera glasses.

Challenges for the Repeatability of Deep Learning Models	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Deep learning; Training; Libraries; Computer architecture; Software; Computational modeling; Microprocessors; Deep learning; Pytorch; torch; Keras; TensorFlow; reproducibility; reproducible; repeatability; replicability; replicable deep learning models; deterministic models; determinism	ARBITRARY PARTICLES; UNBIASED ESTIMATION; NUMBER; PROVENANCE	Deep learning training typically starts with a random sampling initialization approach to set the weights of trainable layers. Therefore, different and/or uncontrolled weight initialization prevents learning the same model multiple times. Consequently, such models yield different results during testing. However, even with the exact same initialization for the weights, a lack of repeatability, replicability, and reproducibility may still be observed during deep learning for many reasons such as software versions, implementation variations, and hardware differences. In this article, we study repeatability when training deep learning models for segmentation and classification tasks using U-Net and LeNet-5 architectures in two development environments Pytorch and Keras (with TensorFlow backend). We show that even with the available control of randomization in Keras and TensorFlow, there are uncontrolled randomizations. We also show repeatable results for the same deep learning architectures using the Pytorch deep learning library. Finally, we discuss variations in the implementation of the weight initialization algorithm across deep learning libraries as a source of uncontrolled error in deep learning results.

The Au@poly(TTP)/rGO/GCE was evaluated using cyclic voltammetry (CV), differential pulse voltammetry (DPV), amperometry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The optimized Au@poly(TTP)/rGO/GCE sensor had a wide electroactive surface area and exhibited good selectivity. The linear determination range of the sensor was from 0.02 to 232 mu M with a sensitivity of 315 mu A/mM/cm(2). The limit of detection (LOD) was estimated to be 11.5 nM using signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio of 3. Additionally, the sensor displayed excellent selectivity, satisfactory response time from 4.5 to 6 s, replicability with a relative standard deviation (RSD) of 2.31%, reproducibility with a RSD of 3.67%, and storage stability with 92.57% of its initial current response for 37 days.

What do Incoming University Students Believe About Open Science Practices in Psychology?	TEACHING OF PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						open science; psychology; teaching; reproducibility; replication	REPLICATION; REPLICABILITY	Background Understanding students' naive conceptions about the norms that guide scientific best practice is important so that teachers can adapt to students' existing understandings. Objective We examined what incoming undergraduate students of psychology believe about reproducibility and open science practices. Method We conducted an online survey with participants who were about to start their first course in psychology at a university (N = 239). Results When asked to indicate how a researcher should conduct her study, most students endorsed several open science practices. When asked to estimate the proportion of published psychological studies that follow various open science practices, participants' estimates averaged near 50%. Only 18% of participants reported that they had heard the term "replication crisis." Conclusion Despite media attention about the replication crisis, few incoming psychology students in our sample were familiar with the term. The students were nevertheless in favour of most open science practices, although they overestimated the prevalence of some of these practices in psychology. Teaching Implications Teachers of incoming psychology students should not assume pre-existing knowledge about open science or replicability.

J	Bird, A				Bird, Alexander			Understanding the Replication Crisis as a Base Rate Fallacy	BRITISH JOURNAL FOR THE PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE			English	Article							PUBLICATION BIAS; POWER; REPLICABILITY; STANDARDS; FALSE; INCENTIVES; TOLERANCE; FAILURE; SCIENCE; SAMPLE	The replication (replicability, reproducibility) crisis in social psychology and clinical medicine arises from the fact that many apparently well-confirmed experimental results are subsequently overturned by studies that aim to replicate the original study. The culprit is widely held to be poor science: questionable research practices, failure to publish negative results, bad incentives, and even fraud. In this article I argue that the high rate of failed replications is consistent with high-quality science. We would expect this outcome if the field of science in question produces a high proportion of false hypotheses prior to testing. If most of the hypotheses under test are false, then there will be many false hypotheses that are apparently supported by the outcomes of well conducted experiments and null hypothesis significance tests with a type-I error rate (alpha) of 5%. Failure to recognize this is to commit the fallacy of ignoring the base rate. I argue that this is a plausible diagnosis of the replication crisis and examine what lessons we thereby learn for the future conduct of science.

Modular Software for Generating and Modeling Diverse Polymer Databases	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL INFORMATION AND MODELING			English	Article							PYTHON PACKAGE; PERCEPTION; SIMULATION; PYSIMM; 4-ARM	Machine learning methods offer the opportunity to designnew functionalmaterials on an unprecedented scale; however, building the large,diverse databases of molecules on which to train such methods remainsa daunting task. Automated computational chemistry modeling workflowsare therefore becoming essential tools in this data-driven hunt fornew materials with novel properties, since they offer a means by whichto create and curate molecular databases without requiring significantlevels of user input. This ensures that well-founded concerns regardingdata provenance, reproducibility, and replicability are mitigated.We have developed a versatile and flexible software package, PySoftK(Python Soft Matter at King's College London) that providesflexible, automated computational workflows to create, model, andcurate libraries of polymers with minimal user intervention. PySoftKis available as an efficient, fully tested, and easily installablePython package. Key features of the software include the wide rangeof different polymer topologies that can be automatically generatedand its fully parallelized library generation tools. It is anticipatedthat PySoftK will support the generation, modeling, and curation oflarge polymer libraries to support functional materials discoveryin the nanotechnology and biotechnology arenas.

Pre-registration: Weighing costs and benefits for researchers	ORGANIZATIONAL BEHAVIOR AND HUMAN DECISION PROCESSES			English	Article						Pre-registration; Open science; Methodology; Replication	REGISTERED REPLICATION REPORT; INCENTIVES; SAMPLE; TRUTH	ABSTR A C T In the past decade, the social and behavioral sciences underwent a methodological revolution, offering practical prescriptions for improving the replicability and reproducibility of research results. One key to reforming science is a simple and scalable practice: pre-registration. Pre-registration constitutes pre-specifying an analysis plan prior to data collection. A growing chorus of articles discusses the prescriptive, field-wide benefits of pre-registration. To increase adoption, however, scientists need to know who currently pre-registers and under -stand perceived barriers to doing so. Thus, we weigh costs and benefits of pre-registration. Our survey of re-searchers reveals generational differences in who pre-registers and uncertainty regarding how pre-registration benefits individual researchers. We leverage these data to directly address researchers' uncertainty by clarifying why pre-registration improves the research process itself. Finally, we discuss how to pre-register and compare available resources. The present work examines the who, why, and how of pre-registration in order to weigh the costs and benefits of pre-registration to researchers and motivate continued adoption.

Despite much promising research currently being undertaken, particularly in imaging, the literature as a whole lacks transparency, clear reporting to facilitate replicability, exploration for potential ethical concerns, and clear demonstrations of effectiveness. Among the many reasons why these problems exist, one of the most important (for which we provide a preliminary solution here) is the current lack of best practice guidance specific to machine learning and artificial intelligence. However, we believe that interdisciplinary groups pursuing research and impact projects involving machine learning and artificial intelligence for health would benefit from explicitly addressing a series of questions concerning transparency, reproducibility, ethics, and effectiveness (TREE). The 20 critical questions proposed here provide a framework for research groups to inform the design, conduct, and reporting; for editors and peer reviewers to evaluate contributions to the literature; and for patients, clinicians and policy makers to critically appraise where new findings may deliver patient benefit.

J	Anderson, SF				Anderson, Samantha F.			Best (but oft forgotten) practices: sample size planning for powerful studies	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NUTRITION			English	Article						sample size; statistical power; effect size; design; methodology	STATISTICAL POWER; PUBLICATION BIAS; RANDOMIZED-TRIALS; P-VALUES; RELIABILITY; PSYCHOLOGY; ACCURACY; FALLIBILITY; INCENTIVES; PREVALENCE	Given recent concerns regarding replicability and trustworthiness in several areas of science, it is vital to encourage researchers to conduct statistically rigorous studies. Achieving a high level of statistical power is one particularly important domain in which researchers can improve the quality and reproducibility of their studies. Although several factors influence statistical power, appropriate sample size planning is often under the control of the researcher and can result in powerful studies. However, the process of conducting sample size planning to achieve a specified level of desired statistical power is often complex and the literature can be difficult to navigate. This article aims to provide an approachable overview of statistical power and sample size planning, with emphasis on why statistical power is important for high-quality science. Thorough examples relevant to nutrition researchers are included to illustrate the process of sample size planning. Special consideration is also given to issues that may arise when conducting sample size planning in practice. The overarching goal is to provide nutrition researchers with the tools and expertise needed to conduct effective sample size planning for future studies.

Materials and methods We studied two independent MRI datasets of 74 lacrymal gland tumors and 30 breast lesions from two different centers. Two pairs of readers performed three two-dimensional delineations for each dataset. Texture features were extracted using two radiomics soft wares (Pyradiomics and an in-house software). Reproducible features were selected using a combination of intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) and concordance and coherence coefficient (CCC) with 0.8 and 0.9 as thresholds, respectively. We tested six absolute and eight relative gray-level discretization methods and analyzed the distribution and highest number of reproducible features obtained for each discretization. We also analyzed the number of reproducible features extracted from computer simulated delineations representative of inter-observer variability. Results The gray-level discretization method had a direct impact on texture feature reproducibility, independent of observers, software or method of delineation (simulated vs. human). The absolute discretization consistently provided statistically significantly more reproducible features than the relative discretization. Varying the bin number of relative discretization led to statistically significantly more variable results than varying the bin size of absolute discretization. Conclusions When considering inter-observer reproducible results of MRI texture radiomics features, an absolute discretization should be favored to allow the extraction of the highest number of potential candidates for new imaging biomarkers. Whichever the chosen method, it should be systematically documented to allow replicability of results.

However, little is known regarding the influence of gender and other cues on zebrafish behavior. Thus, here we analyzed the exploratory and social behavior of different sexes (male and female, mixed or segregated) under different housing conditions with various types of stimuli (visual or/and chemical cues and structural environmental enrichment). Segregated females and males were more active than mixed individuals and females were more anxious. Fish that visualized and smelled the opposite sex presented higher activity and were less anxious than individuals that only smelled or visualized the opposite sex. Fish segregated by sex while being allowed to visualize and smell the opposite sex with the presence of structural environmental enrichment exhibited lower activity and anxiety-like behavior than fish without structural environmental enrichment. Thus, we emphasized that these variables should be taken into account in housing conditions and should be detailed for better replicability and reproducibility of experiments performed with zebrafish.

J	Boeing, G				Boeing, Geoff			The right tools for the job: The case for spatial science tool-building	TRANSACTIONS IN GIS			English	Article							QUALITY ASSESSMENT; STREET NETWORK; LAND-USE; URBAN; OPENSTREETMAP; INFORMATION; ANALYTICS; MODELS; CITIES; GROWTH	This article was presented as the 8th annualTransactions in GISplenary address at the American Association of Geographers annual meeting in Washington, DC. The spatial sciences have recently seen growing calls for more accessible software and tools that better embody geographic science and theory. Urban spatial network science offers one clear opportunity: from multiple perspectives, tools to model and analyze non-planar urban spatial networks have traditionally been inaccessible, atheoretical, or otherwise limiting. This article reflects on this state of the field. Then it discusses the motivation, experience, and outcomes of developing OSMnx, a tool intended to help address this. Next it reviews this tool's use in the recent multidisciplinary spatial network science literature to highlight upstream and downstream benefits of open-source software development. Tool-building is an essential but poorly incentivized component of academic geography and social science more broadly. To conduct better science, we need to build better tools. The article concludes with paths forward, emphasizing open-source software and reusable computational data science beyond mere reproducibility and replicability.

This study aimed to propose a histopathological index to assess, in a quantitative manner, skeletal muscle changes induced by experimental protocols for Rodentia's models. For the development, evaluation of fit and parsimony, replicability, and sensitivity index, Wistar rats from experiments with the same experimental design, but with different variation factors, were used to achieve different levels of damage. The anterior tibial muscle of these animals was collected, processed histologically, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. The adjustment and parsimony of the index were availed through Confirmatory Factor Analysis, reproducibility for evaluation of three people trained through the Intra-Class Correlation, and the discrimination capacity through a one-way ANOVA Test. We pointed out the adjustment for the proposed index while the ICC showed high reproducibility (n = 56; k = 3; ICC = 0.9790) and differences in the extent of damage between groups, following the hierarchical association promoted by experimental model stresses. The results show that the proposed index has a good fit and parsimony (chi(2) = 426.34; p < 0.0001), in addition to being easily replicable by other researchers who know the morphology of muscle tissue and its morphological changes. It is worth mentioning that the development of tools that facilitate histopathological analysis, and that can quantitatively express the findings, are of great importance for the studies of regenerative science, reinforcing the relevance of this study.

Data conversion from raw data to a human-legible/machine-readable data file is one of the key preparation techniques prior to data analysis, where the converted data file should include metainformation. The tools developed by the authors can convert raw data to a structured data package that consists of mandatory and measurement-characterization metadata, primary and raw parameters, and formatted numerical data (FND). The FND are expressed as a matrix type with robust flexibility. This flexibility is achieved by applying the data analysis architecture of schema-on-read, not schema-on-write based on de jure standards, such as ISO documents. The primary parameters are carefully selected from raw parameters, and their vocabularies are transformed from instrument-dependent terms to general terms that everyone can readily understand. The converted data are linked with, for example, specimen information, process information, specimen handling records, and the electronic laboratory notebook. Using this raw-to-repository (R2R) conversion flow, the authors demonstrated that they can generate and store interoperable data files of x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra and depth profiles, powder x-ray diffraction patterns, (scanning) transmission electron microscope images, transmission electron diffraction patterns, electron energy-loss spectroscopy spectra, and calculated electron inelastic mean free path data. Linking measurement data to other required information ensures experimentally repeatable, replicable, and reproducible results. The mandatory and characterization metadata are used for quick electronic searching, and primary and raw parameters are convenient for setting up measurement conditions and useful for reproducibility/replicability and replicability/repeatability, respectively. The FND are human legible and machine readable using parser software, leading to a long lifetime of data utilization. The authors also developed a system to allow the semiautomatic data transfer from an instrument-controlling personal computer (PC) isolated from the communication network by adopting a Wi-Fi-capable secure digital card's scripting capability while keeping the PC offline. They are developing further software for on-demand data manipulation after R2R data conversion. To date, it has been possible to perform XPS peak separation using an automated information compression technique without any a priori assumption. By combining R2R conversion with a high-throughput data collection system and automated data analysis routine, highly reproducible data acquisition and data analysis could be achieved, where human interaction is minimized. At this early stage, the authors demonstrate automated peak separation processing for XPS C 1s and O 1s narrow spectra of polyethylene terephthalate with very high reproducibility.

In this invited idea, we argue that any failure to conduct research according to a documented plan (lack of reliability) and/or any failure to ensure that reconducting the same project would provide the same finding (lack of reproducibility), will result in a low probability of independent studies reaching the same outcome (lack of replicability). After outlining the challenges facing behavioral ecology and science more broadly and incorporating advice from international organizations such as the Center for Open Science (COS), we present clear guidelines and tutorials on what we think open practices represent for behavioral ecologists. In addition, we indicate some of the currently most appropriate and freely available tools for adopting these practices. Finally, we suggest that all journals in our field, such as Behavioral Ecology, give additional weight to transparent studies and therefore provide greater incentives to align our scientific practices to our scientific values. Overall, we argue that producing demonstrably credible science is now fully achievable for the benefit of each researcher individually and for our community as a whole.

Automated Quality Control for Sensor Based Symptom Measurement Performed Outside the Lab	SENSORS			English	Article						Bayesian nonparametrics; clinimetric tests; Parkinson's disease; pattern recognition; quality control; remote monitoring; segmentation; sensors	HIDDEN MARKOV; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; WEARABLE SENSORS; SYSTEM; FRAMEWORK; TECHNOLOGY; MANAGEMENT; MODELS	The use of wearable sensing technology for objective, non-invasive and remote clinimetric testing of symptoms has considerable potential. However, the accuracy achievable with such technology is highly reliant on separating the useful from irrelevant sensor data. Monitoring patient symptoms using digital sensors outside of controlled, clinical lab settings creates a variety of practical challenges, such as recording unexpected user behaviors. These behaviors often violate the assumptions of clinimetric testing protocols, where these protocols are designed to probe for specific symptoms. Such violations are frequent outside the lab and affect the accuracy of the subsequent data analysis and scientific conclusions. To address these problems, we report on a unified algorithmic framework for automated sensor data quality control, which can identify those parts of the sensor data that are sufficiently reliable for further analysis. Combining both parametric and nonparametric signal processing and machine learning techniques, we demonstrate that across 100 subjects and 300 clinimetric tests from three different types of behavioral clinimetric protocols, the system shows an average segmentation accuracy of around 90%. By extracting reliable sensor data, it is possible to strip the data of confounding factors in the environment that may threaten reproducibility and replicability.

J	Yeo-Teh, NSL; Tang, BL				Yeo-Teh, Nicole Shu Ling; Tang, Bor Luen			Research data mismanagement - from questionable research practice to research misconduct	ACCOUNTABILITY IN RESEARCH-POLICIES AND QUALITY ASSURANCE			English	Article; Early Access						Research data management; questionable research practices; research misconduct; research integrity; research ethics		Good record keeping practice and research data management underlie responsible research conduct and promote reproducibility of research findings in the sciences. In many cases of research misconduct, inadequate research data management frequently appear as an accompanying finding. Findings of disorganized or otherwise poor data archival or loss of research data are, on their own, not usually considered as indicative of research misconduct. Focusing on the availability of raw/primary data and the replicability of research based on these, we posit that most, if not all, instances of research data mismanagement (RDMM) could be considered a questionable research practice (QRP). Furthermore, instances of RDMM at their worst could indeed be viewed as acts of research misconduct. Here, we analyze with postulated scenarios the contexts and circumstances under which RDMM could be viewed as a significant misrepresentation of research (ie. falsification), or data fabrication. We further explore how RDMM might potentially be adjudicated as research misconduct based on intent and consequences. Defining how RDMM could constitute QRP or research misconduct would aid the formulation of relevant institutional research integrity policies to mitigate undesirable events stemming from RDMM.

J	Lin, LF; Chu, HT				Lin, Lifeng; Chu, Haitao			Assessing and visualizing fragility of clinical results with binary outcomes in R using the fragility package	PLOS ONE			English	Article							RANDOM-EFFECTS METAANALYSIS; RANDOM-EFFECTS MODELS; NETWORK METAANALYSIS; P-VALUE; STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE; PUBLICATION BIAS; ABSOLUTE RISK; INDEX; TRIALS; DIFFERENCE	With the growing concerns about research reproducibility and replicability, the assessment of scientific results' fragility (or robustness) has been of increasing interest. The fragility index was proposed to quantify the robustness of statistical significance of clinical studies with binary outcomes. It is defined as the minimal event status modifications that can alter statistical significance. It helps clinicians evaluate the reliability of the conclusions. Many factors may affect the fragility index, including the treatment groups in which event status is modified, the statistical methods used for testing for the association between treatments and outcomes, and the pre-specified significance level. In addition to assessing the fragility of individual studies, the fragility index was recently extended to both conventional pairwise meta-analyses and network meta-analyses of multiple treatment comparisons. It is not straightforward for clinicians to calculate these measures and visualize the results. We have developed an R package called "fragility" to offer user-friendly functions for such purposes. This article provides an overview of methods for assessing and visualizing the fragility of individual studies as well as pairwise and network meta-analyses, introduces the usage of the "fragility" package, and illustrates the implementations with several worked examples.

J	Lavoie, I; Campeau, S				Lavoie, Isabelle; Campeau, Stephane			Assemblage diversity, cell density and within-slide variability: Implications for quality assurance/quality control and uncertainty assessment in diatom-based monitoring	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS			English	Article						Assemblage diversity; Bioassessment; Bray-Curtis similarity index; Diatom valve density; Diatoms; Hill's N2; IDEC; Within-slide variability	INDEX; RIVERS	This study was undertaken to evaluate the variability associated with the microscope analysis step in the application of the Eastern Canadian Diatom Index (IDEC: Indite Diatomees de l'Est du Canada), with the general objective of developing a suitable quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) program for this biological index. For this purpose, we estimated within-slide variability (replicability) and inter analysts variability (reproducibility), as a function of diatom assemblage diversity and slide cell density. Overall, our results show that variability associated with diatom assemblage characterization is low, which ensures that IDEC scores reflect environmental changes rather than variability at the microscope analysis step. The main recommendations ensuing from this study are (for the IDEC in particular but also for diatom-based monitoring in general): (1) An error term of +/- 2 IDEC units corresponding to the within-slide variability (replicability) should accompany all reported IDEC scores. (2) A deviation of +/- 3 points from the audit's IDEC scores should be considered as an acceptable difference. Considering the above-mentioned estimated error term of +/- 2 associated with all IDEC scores, an overall deviation of 7 would still be satisfactory. (3) Samples showing low diversity (Hill's N2 <= 5) should automatically be submitted for QA/QC. (4) A Bray-Curtis (analyst vs audit) similarity of >= 60% should also be included as a QA/QC criterion, and should increase to >= 70% for poorly diversified assemblages (Hill's N2 <= 5). (5) A diatom valve density of <= 15 per field of view should be targeted in order to reduce variability at the enumeration step. The results of this study illustrate how a relatively simple and straightforward approach to QA/QC can greatly strengthen the reliability of ecological inferences from an index based on a group of organisms with a high taxonomical diversity. It also highlights the importance of regular communication between analysts in order to maintain a high degree of concordance within taxonomical identification. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

A common method of cell line authentication is the fragment length analysis (FLA) of short-tandem repeats (STR) by capillary electrophoresis. However, this technique is not always accessible and is often costly. Using a microfluidic electrophoresis system, we analyzed the quality and integrity of different murine cell lines by STR profiling. As a proof of concept, we isolated and immortalized hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC) of various genotypes through retroviral transduction of the fusion of the estrogen receptor hormone-binding domain with the coding sequence of HoxB8. Cell lines were maintained in the HPC state with Flt3 ligand (FL) and estrogen treatment and could be characterized upon differentiation. In a validation cohort, we applied this technique on primary mutant Kras-driven pancreatic cancer cell lines, which again allowed for clear discrimination. In summary, our study provides evidence that FLA of STR-amplicons by microfluidic electrophoresis allows for stringent quality control and the tracking of cross-contaminations in both genetically stable HPC lines and cancer cell lines, making it a simple and cost-efficient alternative to traditional capillary electrophoresis.

In this review, we discuss the opportunities that these efforts offer for the field of developmental cognitive neuroscience, in particular developmental neuroimaging. We focus on issues broadly related to statistical power and to flexibility and transparency in data analyses. Critical considerations relating to statistical power include challenges in recruitment and testing of young populations, how to increase the value of studies with small samples, and the opportunities and challenges related to working with large-scale datasets. Developmental studies involve challenges such as choices about age groupings, lifespan modelling, analyses of longitudinal changes, and data that can be processed and analyzed in a multitude of ways. Flexibility in data acquisition, analyses and description may thereby greatly impact results. We discuss methods for improving transparency in developmental neuroimaging, and how preregistration can improve methodological rigor. While outlining challenges and issues that may arise before, during, and after data collection, solutions and resources are highlighted aiding to overcome some of these. Since the number of useful tools and techniques is evergrowing, we highlight the fact that many practices can be implemented stepwise.

In neuroimaging, similar methodological concerns have taken hold of the field, and researchers are working frantically toward finding solutions for the methodological problems specific to neuroimaging. This article examines some ethical and legal implications of this methodological crisis in neuroimaging. With respect to ethical challenges, the article discusses the impact of flawed methods in neuroimaging research in cognitive and clinical neuroscience, particularly with respect to faulty brain-based models of human cognition, behavior, and personality. Specifically examined is whether such faulty models, when they are applied to neurological or psychiatric diseases, could put patients at risk, and whether this places special obligations on researchers using neuroimaging. In the legal domain, the actual use of neuroimaging as evidence in United States courtrooms is surveyed, followed by an examination of ways that the methodological problems may create challenges for the criminal justice system. Finally, the article reviews and promotes some promising ideas and initiatives from within the neuroimaging community for addressing the methodological problems.

Annabel			The Structure of Chaos: An Empirical Comparison of Fractal Physiology Complexity Indices Using NeuroKit2	ENTROPY			English	Article						chaos; complexity; fractal; physiology; noise	ENTROPY	Complexity quantification, through entropy, information theory and fractal dimension indices, is gaining a renewed traction in psychophsyiology, as new measures with promising qualities emerge from the computational and mathematical advances. Unfortunately, few studies compare the relationship and objective performance of the plethora of existing metrics, in turn hindering reproducibility, replicability, consistency, and clarity in the field. Using the NeuroKit2 Python software, we computed a list of 112 (predominantly used) complexity indices on signals varying in their characteristics (noise, length and frequency spectrum). We then systematically compared the indices by their computational weight, their representativeness of a multidimensional space of latent dimensions, and empirical proximity with other indices. Based on these considerations, we propose that a selection of 12 indices, together representing 85.97% of the total variance of all indices, might offer a parsimonious and complimentary choice in regards to the quantification of the complexity of time series. Our selection includes CWPEn, Line Length (LL), BubbEn, MSWPEn, MFDFA (Max), Hjorth Complexity, SVDEn, MFDFA (Width), MFDFA (Mean), MFDFA (Peak), MFDFA (Fluctuation), AttEn. Elements of consideration for alternative subsets are discussed, and data, analysis scripts and code for the figures are open-source.

The biosensing platform is comprised of photo-active NiWO4 nanostructures, in-situ-grown over a conductive substrate (indium tin oxide) using a low-temperature template-based co-precipitation approach. The discussed approach enables the formation of discrete, yet morphologically-analogous, nanostructures with complete coverage (pinhole-free) of the electrode surface. The in-situ-grown nanostructure possess dense population with sharp saw-blade like morphological features that can support substantial immobilisation of anti-NSE agent. The constructed platform demonstrated excellent photo-catalytic activity towards uric acid (UA) which served as the base for the Electrochemical -mechanism (EC) based PEC inhibition sensing. The detection of NSE, relied on its obstruction in analytical signal observed for the photo-oxidation of UA after binding to the electrode surface via protein-antibody interaction. The constructed PEC immunosensor exhibits signal sensitivity up to 0.12 ng mL(-1) of NSE with excellent signal reproducibility and electrode replicability. Moreover, the constructed platform was successfully used for NSE determination in human serum samples.

Radiation-induced oral mucositis hamster model using a linear accelerator enhances clinical relevance of preclinical studies for treatment strategy investigation	ANIMAL MODELS AND EXPERIMENTAL MEDICINE			English	Article						animal models; radiotherapy; stomatitis	CHEEK POUCH; EFFICACY	Translational animal models for oral mucositis (OM) are necessary to simulate and assess the bioclinical effects and response in humans. These models should simulate high levels of radiation exposure that leads to oxidative stress and inflammatory-initiated tissue changes. Hamster models have been extensively studied to observe pathological effects of radiation exposure and help in the development of effective treatments. To successfully evaluate the potential for treatment regimens with consistency and relevance, a radiation-induced OM hamster model was developed using a clinical linear accelerator utilized by cancer patients daily. The dose exposure to the isolated, everted cheek pouch of a hamster, as well as the progression of injury, pro-inflammatory marker, histological, and elasticity analyses of the buccal pouch were conducted to verify replicability and reproducibility of the injury model. The findings from this model demonstrated its ability to consistently induce injury and resolution over 28 days using an acute dose of 60 Gy. This model was developed to enhance clinical relevance when evaluating potential efficacious treatments and can now be utilized in efficacy studies to better evaluate developed therapeutics in a preclinical model that is easy to translate to clinical studies..

For a study involving radiation exposure to be replicable, interpretable, and comparable, its experimental methodology must be well reported, particularly in terms of irradiation protocol, including the amount, rate, quality, and geometry of radiation delivery. Here we perform the first large-scale literature review of the current state of reporting of essential experimental physics and dosimetry details in the scientific literature. Methods and Materials: For 1758 peer-reviewed articles from 469 journals, we evaluated the reporting of basic experimental physics and dosimetry details recommended by the authoritative National Institute of Standards and Technology symposium. Results: We demonstrate that although some physics and dosimetry parameters, such as dose, source type, and energy, are well reported, the majority are not. Furthermore, highly cited journals and articles are systematically more likely to be lacking experimental details related to the irradiation protocol. Conclusions: These findings show a crucial deficiency in the reporting of basic experimental details and severely affect the reproducibility and translatability of a large proportion of radiation biology studies.

However, the use of laboratory automation in academic laboratories is limited due to high acquisition costs and the inability to customize off-the-shelf hardware. To address these challenges, we present an Open Source Hardware concept, referred to as OpenWorkstation, to build an assembly line-inspired platform consisting of ready-to-use and customizable modules. In contrast to current standalone solutions, the OpenWorkstation concept enables the combination of single hardware modules - each with a specific set of functionalities - to a modular workstation to provide a fully automated setup. The base setup consists of a pipetting and transport module and is designed to execute basic protocol steps for in vitro research applications, including pipetting operations for liquids and viscous substances and transportation of cell culture vessels between the modules. We demonstrate the successful application of this concept within a case study by the development of a storage module to facilitate high-throughput studies and a photo-crosslinker module to initiate photo-induced polymerization of hydrogel solutions. We present a Systems Engineering framework for customized module development, guidance for the design and assembly of the presented modules, and operational instructions on the usage of the workstation. By combining capabilities from various open source instrumentations into a modular technology platform, the OpenWorkstation concept will facilitate efficient and reliable experimentation for in vitro research. Ultimately, this concept will allow academic groups to improve replicability and reproducibility in cell culture process operations towards more economical and innovative research in the future.

Meanwhile, critical reviews have emerged that suggest that ML/DL should be used cautiously. To improve the applicability and generalizability of ML/DL-related SE studies, we conducted a 12-year Systematic Literature Review (SLR) on 1,428 ML/DL-related SE papers published between 2009 and 2020. Our trend analysis demonstrated the impacts that ML/DL brought to SE. We examined the complexity of applying ML/DL solutions to SE problems and how such complexity led to issues concerning the reproducibility and replicability of ML/DL studies in SE. Specifically, we investigated how ML and DL differ in data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation when applied to SE tasks, and what details need to be provided to ensure that a study can be reproduced or replicated. By categorizing the rationales behind the selection of ML/DL techniques into five themes, we analyzed how model performance, robustness, interpretability, complexity, and data simplicity affected the choices of ML/DL models.

Crafting statistical analysis plans: A cross-discipline approach	STAT			English	Article						collaboration; communication; documentation; reproducibility; statistical design; study design	MULTIVARIATE ANALYSES; PROTOCOL; DESIGN	Developing a plan for data analysis at the beginning of a study is an important practice that is underutilized in many scientific fields. Several funding agencies and journals now require submission of statistical analysis plans in advance of scientific studies, particularly in the clinical sciences. Even when a plan is not required, it can be advantageous to the scientific process by improving reproducibility. An analysis plan allows researchers to organize their knowledge about their research questions and experimental design to more easily recognize and choose the appropriate statistical analyses. An analysis plan provides a roadmap for the analyses: Researchers can think through potential statistical decisions (e.g. to transform or not to transform? how to handle missing or censored data?) in advance and thoroughly document the justifications and trade-offs for their intended analyses. Such decisions are not influenced by data when made before data collection, thus preventing pitfalls like p-hacking, HARKing and non-replicability of results. We describe a general framework for crafting an analysis plan-including essential components of any plan-and provide an example template that can be used by researchers. The analysis plan framework is presented for broad appeal to experienced statisticians, quantitative researchers and everyone in between.

Mouse Phenome Database: an integrative database and analysis suite for curated empirical phenotype data from laboratory mice	NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH			English	Article							REPRODUCIBILITY; RESOURCES; ONTOLOGY; BEHAVIOR	The Mouse Phenome Database (MPD; https://phenome.jax.org) is a widely used resource that provides access to primary experimental trait data, genotypic variation, protocols and analysis tools for mouse genetic studies. Data are contributed by investigators worldwide and represent a broad scope of phenotyping endpoints and disease-related traits in naive mice and those exposed to drugs, environmental agents or other treatments. MPD houses individual animal data with detailed, searchable protocols, and makes these data available to other resources via API. MPD provides rigorous curation of experimental data and supporting documentation using relevant ontologies and controlled vocabularies. Most data in MPD are from inbreds and other reproducible strains such that the data are cumulative over time and across laboratories. The resource has been expanded to include the QTL Archive and other primary phenotype data from mapping crosses as well as advanced high-diversity mouse populations including the Collaborative Cross and Diversity Outbred mice. Furthermore, MPD provides a means of assessing replicability and reproducibility across experimental conditions and protocols, benchmarking assays in users' own laboratories, identifying sensitized backgrounds for making new mouse models with genome editing technologies, analyzing trait co-inheritance, finding the common genetic basis for multiple traits and assessing sex differences and sex-by-genotype interactions.

Reproducibility in forecasting research	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FORECASTING			English	Article						Forecasting practice; Replication; Seasonal forecasting; Empirical research	ACCURACY	The importance of replication has been recognised across many scientific disciplines. Reproducibility is a necessary condition for replicability, because an inability to reproduce results implies that the methods have not been specified sufficiently, thus precluding replication. This paper describes how two independent teams of researchers attempted to reproduce the empirical findings of an important paper, "Shrinkage estimators of time series seasonal factors and their effect on forecasting accuracy" (Miller & Williams, 2003). The two teams proceeded systematically, reporting results both before and after receiving clarifications from the authors of the original study. The teams were able to approximately reproduce each other's results, but not those of Miller and Williams. These discrepancies led to differences in the conclusions as to the conditions under which seasonal damping outperforms classical decomposition. The paper specifies the forecasting methods employed using a flowchart. It is argued that this approach to method documentation is complementary to the provision of computer code, as it is accessible to a broader audience of forecasting practitioners and researchers. The significance of this research lies not only in its lessons for seasonal forecasting but also, more generally, in its approach to the reproduction of forecasting research.

J	Soch, J; Allefeld, C				Soch, Joram; Allefeld, Carsten			MACS - a new SPM toolbox for model assessment, comparison and selection	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						fMRI-based neuroimaging; mass-univariate GLM; SPM toolbox; analysis pipelines; model assessment; model comparison; model selection; model averaging	DYNAMIC CAUSAL-MODELS; FMRI TIME-SERIES; BAYESIAN-INFERENCE; FREE-ENERGY; TESTS	Background: In cognitive neuroscience, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data are widely analyzed using general linear models (GLMs). However, model quality of GLMs for fMRI is rarely assessed, in part due to the lack of formal measures for statistical model inference. New method: We introduce a new SPM toolbox for model assessment, comparison and selection (MACS) of GLMs applied to fMRI data. MACS includes classical, information-theoretic and Bayesian methods of model assessment previously applied to GLMs for fMRI as well as recent methodological developments of model selection and model averaging in fMRI data analysis. Results: The toolbox which is freely available from GitHub directly builds on the Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) software package and is easy-to-use, general-purpose, modular, readable and extendable. We validate the toolbox by reproducing model selection and model averaging results from earlier publications. Comparison with existing methods: A previous toolbox for model diagnosis in fMRI has been discontinued and other approaches to model comparison between GLMs have not been translated into reusable computational resources in the past. Conclusions: Increased attention on model quality will lead to lower false-positive rates in cognitive neuroscience and increased application of the MACS toolbox will increase the reproducibility of GLM analyses and is likely to increase the replicability of fMRI studies.

EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF WORK AND ORGANIZATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						open science practices; reproducibility; replicability; academic reward system	QUESTIONABLE RESEARCH PRACTICES; STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT; REPLICATION; CRISIS; PREREGISTRATION; REPRODUCIBILITY; REPLICABILITY; DETERMINANTS; INCENTIVES; SECTION	To address the low reproducibility and replicability of research, Open Science Practices (OSPs) have been developed. Yet, despite increasing awareness of their potential benefits, there has been only little implementation. As journals can act as gatekeepers for scientific discoveries, a potential tendency not to mention OSPs on their websites may help to explain this implementation gap. Therefore, we examined the implementation of OSPs and potential barriers in industrial and organizational psychology and management (IOP/management) journals. Study 1 examined whether and how N = 257 journal websites referred to OSPs. We found that most journals did not mention OSPs. Specifically, only two (1.0%), five (2.5%), and 14 (6.9%) IOP/management journals mentioned preregistration, registered reports, and explicitly welcomed replications, respectively. Study 2 investigated perceived barriers to implementing OSPs with a survey among editors of the IOP/management journals from Study 1. Among the 40 responding editors, 14, 10, and five attributed the lacking implementation of OSPs to a lesser suitability of OSPs for qualitative research, missing authority, and missing familiarity with OSPs, respectively. Based on our findings, the implementation gap could be mitigated by developing new and refining extant OSPs, starting bottom-up initiatives (e.g., researchers directly contacting publishers), and increasing the availability of information on OSPs.

Within the platform, an origin-destination-time (ODT) data model is proposed to work with scalable query engines to handle heterogenous mobility data in large volumes with extensive spatial coverage, which allows for efficient extraction, query, and aggregation of billion-level origin-destination (OD) flows in parallel at the server-side. An interactive spatial web portal, ODT Flow Explorer, is developed to allow users to explore multi-source mobility datasets with user-defined spatiotemporal scales. To promote reproducibility and replicability, we further develop ODT Flow REST APIs that provide researchers with the flexibility to access the data programmatically via workflows, codes, and programs. Demonstrations are provided to illustrate the potential of the APIs integrating with scientific workflows and with the Jupyter Notebook environment. We believe the platform coupled with the derived multi-scale mobility data can assist human mobility monitoring and analysis during disaster events such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and benefit both scientific communities and the general public in understanding human mobility dynamics.

Design: Longitudinal observational cohort study. Methods: Study sample included 720 HIV-1 seropositive persons (317 with ANI and 403 NP-N) receiving care in Toronto, Canada [83% were on antiretroviral treatment; 71% had undetectable (<50 copies/ml) plasma HIVRNA]. Neuropsychological assessments were conducted at 12 months intervals for a median follow-up time of 34 months. Neuropsychological data were corrected for age, education, sex, and race/ethnicity, and corrected for practice effect at follow-ups. Progression to mild neurocognitive disorder and HIV-associated dementia at each time point was determined using the Global Deficit Score and presence of cognitive symptoms. Results: Over the follow-up period, 170 individuals (24%) progressed to symptomatic HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). Persons with ANI were more likely to progress to symptomatic HAND than persons with NP-N after adjusting for baseline and time-varying confounders (adjusted hazards ratio: 1.88; 95% confidence interval: 1.37-2.60; P < 0.001). Female sex, depression, and cigarette smoking were associated with higher risk of progression to symptomatic HAND, but traditional HIV markers and antiretroviral treatment were not. Conclusion: ANI is associated with a two-fold increased risk of progression to symptomatic HAND in a cohort with universal healthcare access. This represents the largest replication of comparable US results. Reproducibility of these findings indicate that routine monitoring of persons with ANI and exploration of clinical interventions to prevent or delay progression to symptomatic HAND are imperative.

More recently occupant-behavior models have been developed for including people in the building control loops. However, while important objectives of scientific research are reproducibility and replicability of results, not all information is available from published documents. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to propose a guideline for a thorough and standardized occupant-behavior model documentation. For that purpose, the literature screening for the existing occupant behavior models in building control was conducted, and the occupant behavior modeling processes were studied to extract practices and gaps for each of the following phases: problem state-ment, data collection, and preprocessing, model development, model evaluation, and model implementation. The literature screening pointed out that the current state-of-the-art on model documentation shows little uni-fication, which poses a particular burden for the model application and replication in field studies. In addition to the standardized model documentation, this work presented a model-evaluation schema that enabled bench-marking of different models in field settings as well as the recommendations on how OB models are integrated with the building system.

A Step-By-Step Guide on Preregistration and Effective Data Sharing for Psychopathology Research	JOURNAL OF ABNORMAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						replicability; reproducibility; experimental psychopathology; R	STATISTICAL POWER; PSYCHOLOGY; TESTS; PRIMER	Data analysis in psychopathology research typically entails multiple stages of data preprocessing (e.g., coding of physiological measures), statistical decisions (e.g., inclusion of covariates), and reporting (e.g., selecting which variables best answer the research questions). The complexity and lack of transparency of these procedures have resulted in two troubling trends: the central hypotheses and analytical approaches are often selected after observing the data, and the research data are often not properly indexed. These practices are particularly problematic for (experimental) psychopathology research because the data are often hard to gather due to the target populations (e.g.. individuals with mental disorders), and because the standard methodological approaches are challenging and time consuming (e.g., longitudinal studies). Here, we present a workflow that covers study preregistration. data anonymization, and the easy sharing of data and experimental material with the rest of the research community. This workflow is tailored to both original studies and secondary statistical analyses of archival data sets. In order to facilitate the implementation of the described workflow, we have developed a free and open-source software program. We argue that this workflow will result in more transparent and easily shareable psychopathology research, eventually increasing and replicability reproducibility in our research field.

A Statistical View of Replicability in Psychological Science	PERSPECTIVES ON PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCE			English	Article						replication; prediction intervals; p values; reproducibility; Reproducibility Project: Psychology	P-VALUES; POWER	A recent study of the replicability of key psychological findings is a major contribution toward understanding the human side of the scientific process. Despite the careful and nuanced analysis reported, the simple narrative disseminated by the mass, social, and scientific media was that in only 36% of the studies were the original results replicated. In the current study, however, we showed that 77% of the replication effect sizes reported were within a 95% prediction interval calculated using the original effect size. Our analysis suggests two critical issues in understanding replication of psychological studies. First, researchers' intuitive expectations for what a replication should show do not always match with statistical estimates of replication. Second, when the results of original studies are very imprecise, they create wide prediction intervalsand a broad range of replication effects that are consistent with the original estimates. This may lead to effects that replicate successfully, in that replication results are consistent with statistical expectations, but do not provide much information about the size (or existence) of the true effect. In this light, the results of the Reproducibility Project: Psychology can be viewed as statistically consistent with what one might expect when performing a large-scale replication experiment.

FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						reproducibility movement; failed replications; researcher gender; career impact; gender stereotypes	SCIENCE; WOMEN; MASCULINITY; BACKLASH; CRISIS; BIAS; REPRESENTATION; STEREOTYPES; WORKPLACE; CULTURE	The reproducibility movement in psychology has resulted in numerous highly publicized instances of replication failures. The goal of the present work was to investigate people's reactions to a psychology replication failure vs. success, and to test whether a failure elicits harsher reactions when the researcher is a woman vs. a man. We examined these questions in a pre-registered experiment with a working adult sample, a conceptual replication of that experiment with a student sample, and an analysis of data compiled and posted by a psychology researcher on their public weblog with the stated goal to improve research replicability by rank-ordering psychology researchers by their "estimated false discovery risk." Participants in the experiments were randomly assigned to read a news article describing a successful vs. failed replication attempt of original work from a male vs. female psychological scientist, and then completed measures of researcher competence, likability, integrity, perceptions of the research, and behavioral intentions for future interactions with the researcher. In both working adult and student samples, analyses consistently yielded large main effects of replication outcome, but no interaction with researcher gender. Likewise, the coding of weblog data posted in July 2021 indicated that 66.3% of the researchers scrutinized were men and 33.8% were women, and their rank-ordering was not correlated with researcher gender. The lack of support for our pre-registered gender-replication hypothesis is, at first glance, encouraging for women researchers' careers; however, the substantial effect sizes we observed for replication outcome underscore the tremendous negative impact the reproducibility movement can have on psychologists' careers. We discuss the implications of such negative perceptions and the possible downstream consequences for women in the field that are essential for future study.

Published research, however, can be useful for theory or application only if it is credible. In science, a credible finding is one that has repeatedly survived risky falsification attempts. However, state-of-the-art meta-analytic approaches cannot determine the credibility of an effect because they do not account for the extent to which each included study has survived such attempted falsification. To overcome this problem, we outline a unified framework for estimating the credibility of published research by examining four fundamental falsifiability-related dimensions: (a) transparency of the methods and data, (b) reproducibility of the results when the same data-processing and analytic decisions are reapplied, (c) robustness of the results to different data-processing and analytic decisions, and (d) replicability of the effect. This framework includes a standardized workflow in which the degree to which a finding has survived scrutiny is quantified along these four facets of credibility. The framework is demonstrated by applying it to published replications in the psychology literature. Finally, we outline a Web implementation of the framework and conclude by encouraging the community of researchers to contribute to the development and crowdsourcing of this platform.

The WRFQ is a generic role-specific instrument that measures how a particular health status influences the ability to meet work demands. Methods We performed an observational study among German employees assessing the following measurement properties: 1) structural, 2) convergent and 3) discriminant validity, 4) floor and ceiling effects, 5) internal consistency, 6) reproducibility and 7) responsiveness. Participants were recruited from an online access panel sample aged 18 to 64 years having worked more than 12 hours in the last 4 weeks prior to study enrollment (n((T0)) = 653, n((T1)) = 66, n((T2)) = 95). Results Measurement properties proved to be good except for structural validity and responsiveness. An exploratory factor analysis showed limited replicability of three of the four original subscales. Conclusion With the WRFQ German version, the extent can be measured, to which employees with a certain health level experience problems can meet their work demands. This widely used health-related work outcome measurement tool, that helps to identify employees with decreasing work functioning, is now also available in German. This gives researchers and practitioners the opportunity to address work functioning in practice, e.g. in intervention studies in occupational health or rehabilitation. Further research to examine valid subscales is needed.

There exist several methods to measure doses such as chemical and gel dosimetry. In this study, a novel dosimeter was evaluated capable of reading with both MRI & spectrofluorometer. Trimesic acid with different concentrations and pH was mixed with a matrix of gelatin & acrylamide gel and were poured at different vials to be exposed at different doses up to 200 cGy at two temperature of 4 degrees C and 25 degrees C and the readings were used to extract calibration curves for MRI with different TE2s & spectrofluorometer methods which Pearson correlation coefficient (R-2) for each method & their interaction were used to find out the best conditions. The results were obtained as dosimeter calibration curves with related R-2 of two different reading methods of MRI & spectroflourimetry in dose range of 0-200 cGy. The R-2 was a measure to compare different experimental groups & also an interaction between MRI and spectroflourimetry R(2)s was considered to determine which combination results to a better two reading, simultaneously. It was showed that in the considered dose range, at lower temperature of 4 degrees C, weak acidity & lower concentration of Trimesic acid, the proposed dosimeter seems to be a two reading or hybrid dosimeter.

Chaos is a pervasive occurrence in these circuits, particularly after manual adjustment of a variable resistor placed in series with the supply voltage source. Following this approach, 49 unique circuits generating chaotic signals when physically realized were designed, representing the largest collection of circuits of this kind to date. These circuits are atypical as they do not trivially map onto known topologies or variations thereof. They feature diverse spectra and predominantly anti-persistent monofractal dynamics. Notably, we recurrently found a circuit comprising one resistor, one transistor, two inductors, and one capacitor, which generates a range of attractors depending on the parameter values. We also found a circuit yielding an irregular quantized spike-train resembling some aspects of neural discharge and another one generating a double-scroll attractor, which represent the smallest known transistor-based embodiments of these behaviors. Through three representative examples, we additionally show that diffusive coupling of heterogeneous oscillators of this kind may give rise to complex entrainment, such as lag synchronization with directed information transfer and generalized synchronization. The replicability and reproducibility of the experimental findings are good. Published by AIP Publishing.

Industrialization of a perfusion bioreactor: Prime example of a non-straightforward process	JOURNAL OF TISSUE ENGINEERING AND REGENERATIVE MEDICINE			English	Article						bioreactors; Design of Experiment; industrialization; risk assessment; tissue engineering; validation master plan	STEM-CELLS; TISSUE; CULTURE; SCAFFOLDS; SYSTEMS; OPTIMIZATION; GENERATION; THERAPIES; PHOSPHATE; DENSITY	Bioreactors are essential enabling technologies for the translation of advanced therapies medicinal products from the research field towards a successful clinical application. In order to speed up the translation and the spread of novel tissue engineering products into the clinical routine, tissue engineering bioreactors should evolve from laboratory prototypes towards industrialized products. In this work, we thus challenged the industrialization process of a novel technological platform, based on an established research prototype of perfusion bioreactor, following a GMP-driven approach. We describe how the combination of scientific background, intellectual property, start-up factory environment, wise industrial advice in the biomedical field, design, and regulatory consultancy allowed us to turn a previously validated prototype technology into an industrial product suitable for serial production with improved replicability and user-friendliness. The solutions implemented enhanced aesthetics, ergonomics, handling, and safety of the bioreactor, and they allowed compliance with the fundamental requirements in terms of traceability, reproducibility, efficiency, and safety of the manufacturing process of advanced therapies medicinal products. The result is an automated incubator-compatible device, housing 12 disposable independent perfusion chambers for seeding and culture of any perfusable tissue. We validated the cell seeding process of the industrialized bioreactor by means of the Design of Experiment approach, whilst the effectiveness of perfusion culture was evaluated in the context of bone tissue engineering.

Ethical Replicability and Reproducibility in GIScience and Its Critical Applications	ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF GEOGRAPHERS			English	Article						disaster response; GIScience; location privacy; provenance; replicability and reproducibility	LOCATION PRIVACY	As replicability and reproducibility (R&R) crises develop within emerging convergent inquiry, ethical use of provenance information is central to the establishment and preservation of trust in critical applications of GIScience and geospatial technologies. Today large volumes of geospatial data are generated at high velocity from satellite sensors and unmanned aircraft systems, citizen sensors, geolocation-based data services, global navigation satellite systems, and so on. The extensive use of these data for applications such as disaster and humanitarian response raises the issue of R&R from competing perspectives of location privacy and geospatial data quality. Although geospatial data can be integrated and linked with contextual information to identify individuals' movements, steps taken to ensure privacy can complicate the multiuser development of high-quality geospatial workflows. Provenance information as digital records of historical (retrospective) and potential future (prospective) geospatial processes is often overlooked, misunderstood, or inadequately addressed. We explore the relationship between provenance information, location privacy, and geospatial data quality in the context of R&R with a focus on disaster analytics. We argue that in the era of big data and deep learning, GIScientists and associated institutions bear greater responsibility both for geospatial workflow quality and for location privacy. Given vastly heterogenous computational landscapes, we provide practical recommendations for ethically driven provenance and R&R research and development within the GIScience community and beyond.

These methods, however, tend to involve numerous forking paths and researcher degrees of freedom, even beyond those typically encountered with other research methodologies. Although a number of researchers working with ESM techniques are actively engaged in efforts to increase the methodological rigor and transparency of research that uses them, currently there is little routine implementation of open-science practices in ESM research. In this article, we discuss the ways in which ESM research is especially vulnerable to threats to transparency, reproducibility, and replicability. We propose that greater use of study registration, a cornerstone of open science, may address some of these threats to the transparency of ESM research. Registration of ESM research is not without challenges, including model selection, accounting for potential model-convergence issues, and the use of preexisting data sets. As these may prove to be significant barriers for ESM researchers, we also discuss ways of overcoming these challenges and of documenting them in a registration. A further challenge is that current general preregistration templates do not adequately capture the unique features of ESM. We present a registration template for ESM research and also discuss registration of studies using preexisting data.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of SPT of five laboratories in Quebec (Canada) on chemical parameters measurement reliability. Samples of fine (G1), medium (G2), and coarse (G3) textured soils were collected from the surface layer. Three 500 g portions of each soil were sent to each laboratory for preparation. In addition, all samples were analyzed by the same laboratory for routine analyses. Nested ANOVA in a hierarchical model were performed with components of SPT interlaboratory reproducibility, SPT intralaboratory replicability, and intralaboratory soil analysis repeatability. Before samples were analyzed, we observed an important interlaboratory heterogeneity of particle size distributions for the same samples; due to sample preparation techniques, this can affect results of the analyses. Of all variables analyzed, the only significant, outside acceptable variations due to SPT were (1) pH(water) in G1; (2) PM-III, AlM-III, and (P/Al)(M-III) in G1 and G2; (3) KM-III, CaM-III, MgM-III and organic matter in G3; and (4) MnM-III and CuM-III in G1, G2, and G3. The steps in SPT, mostly drying and crushing, require standardization to reduce the variance of the entire soil testing process.

Vaginal leiomyoma is a rare benign tumor, with only a few cases being reported in the literature. we demonstrate a novel approach for excision of a vaginal leiomyoma via vNOTES. To ensure reproducibility and replicability akin to a standardized procedure, we have provided a step-by-step video description of the use of vNOTES for upper anterior vaginal myomectomy. Patient concerns: A 35-year-old female (G2P0A2) presented with a tumor in the upper anterior vaginal wall, which gradually increased in size. Diagnosis: A vaginal examination revealed a swollen area approximately 3-cm in diameter on the upper anterior vaginal wall. The swelling was mobile and solid. All other vitals were normal. Transvaginal ultrasound detected a 3.0 x 3.4 cm hypoechogenic mass on the superior vaginal wall, and a preoperative diagnosis of the vaginal tumor was confirmed. Interventions: The upper vaginal leiomyoma treated using transvaginal natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery. Outcomes: The procedure lasted for 20 min, and the postoperative course was uneventful. Conclusions: vNOTES can be a promising alternative to traditional vaginal surgery for upper vaginal disease due to advantages such as excellent exposure, easy access and precise suturing. However, more studies are needed to assess its long-term efficacy.

Reversible Soft Top-Contacts to Yield Molecular Junctions with Precise and Reproducible Electrical Characteristics	ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS			English	Article							SELF-ASSEMBLED MONOLAYERS; ALKYL-THIOL MONOLAYERS; GALLIUM-INDIUM EGAIN; CHARGE-TRANSPORT; TUNNELING JUNCTIONS; LIQUID-METAL; GOLD; ALKANETHIOLS; CONDUCTANCE; ELECTRONICS	The reproducibility of the electrical characteristics of molecular junctions has been notoriously low. This paper describes a method to construct tunnel junctions based on self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) by forming reversible electrical contacts to SAMs using top-electrodes of a non-Newtonian liquid-metal (GaOx/EGaIn) stabilized in a microfluidic-based device. A single top-electrode can be used to form up to 15-25 junctions. This method generates SAM-based junctions with highly reproducible electrical characteristics in terms of precision (widths of distributions) and replicability (closeness to a reference value). The reason is that this method, unlike other approaches that rely on cross-bar or nano/micropore configurations, does not require patterning of the bottom-electrodes and is compatible with ultra-flat template-stripped (TS) surfaces. This compatibly with non-patterned electrodes is important for three reasons. i) No edges of the electrodes are present at which SAMs cannot pack well. ii) Patterning requires photoresist that may contaminate the electrode and complicate SAM formation. iii) TS-surfaces contain large grains, have low rms values, and can be obtained and used (in ordinary laboratory conditions) within a few seconds to minimize contamination. The junctions have very good electrical stability (2500 current-voltage cycles and retained currents for 27 h), and can be fabricated with good yields (approximate to 78%).

Over the past 30 years, swale design has evolved with more emphasis on swale outflow quality, but still has a strong empirical basis. Therefore, there is a need to gain insight into the design aspects that could impinge on the treatment efficiency of a swale. To address these knowledge gaps, two pilot swales were specifically designed and built at the CSTB Nantes. Differences between the pilot swales derived from their soil materials in order to assess and compare the performances of a standard swale and a filtering swale. For this purpose, the pilot swales were equipped with a runoff simulator and various measuring devices (i.e. flowmeters and soil moisture sensors). Given the importance to generate high-quality data, the present paper details this measurement chain and examines its operation by simulating the same runoff event six times between November 2017 and April 2018. The reproducibility of the swale responses is discussed in light of the test procedure and the estimated measurement uncertainties. Overall, results emphasize the high reproducibility of the swale hydraulic responses and demonstrate that pollutant fluxes can be accurately monitored at the inlet and the outlet of each swale. Regarding hydraulic indicators, slight dispersion (variation coefficient cv < 5%) of the ratios between outgoing and incoming water (S/E) and between infiltrated and runoff water (I) are likely due to non-similar initial conditions (e.g., natural rainfall preceding the runoff event). Regarding performance indicators of the stormwater treatment, the mass and concentration reduction efficiencies for zinc (Zn) and copper (Cu) are within the estimated replicability boundaries. Nevertheless, the high contamination level of Zn in incoming stormwater could explain the lower dispersion of its removal (cv < 30%) with respect to the dispersion of Cu removal (-185% <= cv <= 176%). Overall, the estimated uncertainties of both the monitoring devices and the analytical methods were identified as potential explanations for the observed variations.

J	Shuster, LI; Cottrill, C				Shuster, Linda I.; Cottrill, Claire			Ease of articulation: A replication	JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION DISORDERS			English	Article						Replication; Speech acquisition; Articulation	PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCE; REPLICABILITY; ACTIVATION; CRISIS; SPEECH	Researchers, as well as the lay public and the popular press, have become increasingly concerned about the lack of reproducibility of research findings. Despite this concern, research has shown that replications of previously published work comprise a very small proportion of published studies. Moreover, there are fewer published direct replications of research studies by independent investigators, and this type of replication is much less likely to confirm the results of the original research than are replications by the original investigator or conceptual replications. A search of the communication disorders research literature reveals that direct replications by independent investigators are virtually non-existent. The purpose of this project was to describe the major issues related to research reproducibility and report the results of a direct replication of a study by Locke (1972) regarding ease of articulation. Two methods for rating ease of articulation were employed. We were able to reproduce the results of the original study for the first method, obtaining a moderate positive correlation between our rankings of phoneme difficulty and Locke's rankings. We obtained a very high positive correlation between our phoneme rankings and rankings obtained in the original study for the second method. Moreover, we found a higher correlation between difficulty rankings and order of speech sound acquisition for American English than was found in the original study. Direct replication is not necessary for all studies in communication disorders, but should be considered for high impact studies, treatment studies, and those that provide data to support models and theories. Learning outcomes: The reader will be able to: (1) describe the major concerns related to the replicability of research findings; (2) describe the status of research replications in communication disorders; (3) describe how ease of articulation may relate to the order of speech sound acquisition in children; (4) list some types/areas of research that might be candidates for replication in the field of communication disorders.

Recalcitrance of Cannabis sativa to de novo regeneration; a multi-genotype replication study	PLOS ONE			English	Article							PLANT-REGENERATION; LIGHT QUALITY; SOMATIC EMBRYOGENESIS; INVITRO-PROPAGATION; CALLUS INDUCTION; L.; GROWTH; HEMP	Cannabis sativa is relatively recalcitrant to de novo regeneration, but several studies have reported shoot organogenesis or somatic embryogenesis from non-meristematic tissues. Most report infrequent regeneration rates from these tissues, but a landmark publication from 2010 achieved regeneration from leaf explants with a 96% response rate, producing an average of 12.3 shoots per explant in a single drug-type accession. Despite the importance regeneration plays in plant biotechnology and the renewed interest in this crop the aforementioned protocol has not been used in subsequent papers in the decade since it was published, raising concerns over its reproducibility. Here we attempted to replicate this important Cannabis regeneration study and expand the original scope of the study by testing it across 10 drug-type C. sativa genotypes to assess genotypic variation. In our study, callus was induced in all 10 genotypes but callus growth and appearance substantially differed among cultivars, with the most responsive genotype producing 6-fold more callus than the least responsive. The shoot induction medium failed to induce shoot organogenesis in any of the 10 cultivars tested, instead resulting in necrosis of the calli. The findings of this replication study raise concerns about the replicability of existing methods. However, some details of the protocol could not be replicated due to missing details in the original paper and regulatory issues, which could have impacted the outcome. These results highlight the importance of using multiple genotypes in such studies and providing detailed methods to facilitate replication.

Such efforts have led to many insights on the travel behavior and activity patterns of people. Despite these achievements, the data veracity issue and its impact on the processes of knowledge discovery have seldom been discussed. In this research, we investigate the veracity issue of mobile signaling data (MSD) when they are used to characterize human mobility patterns. We first discuss the location uncertainty issues in MSD that would hinder accurate estimations of human mobility patterns, followed by an examination of two existing methods for addressing these issues (clustering-based method and time window-based method). We then propose a new approach that can overcome some of the limitations of these two methods. By applying all three methods to a large-scale mobile signaling data set, we find that the choice of preprocessing methods could lead to changes in the data characteristics. Such changes, which are nontrivial, will further affect the characterization and interpretation of human mobility patterns. By computing four mobility indicators (number of origin-destination trips, number of activity locations, total stay time, and activity entropy) from the outputs of the three methods, we illustrate their varying impacts on individual mobility estimations relevant to location uncertainty issues. Our analysis results call for more attention to the veracity issue in data-driven mobility research and its implications for replicability and reproducibility of geospatial research.

Classification of artificial light sources and estimation of Color Rendering Index using RGB sensors, K Nearest Neighbor and Radial Basis Function	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL ON SMART SENSING AND INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS			English	Article						Color Rendering Index; CRI; light sources; Correlated Color Temperature; CCT; K Nearest Neighbor; Radial Basis Function; RBF; RGB sensors	SYSTEM; DESIGN	Three types of artificial light sources work with electricity: incandescent, fluorescent and LED. These sources require characterization processes to allow selecting the most suitable for the application, to evaluate their capacity or more recently to tune and adjust their replicability using control algorithms. Therefore, it has been necessary to develop indices that represent these capabilities. The Color Rendering Index (CRI) is a measure used to characterize the color reproducibility of a light source in comparison to an ideal light source. The Correlated Color Temperature (CCT) is used to characterize light sources by representing the color as the temperature of a black body in Kelvin that shows nearly the same chromaticity as the analyzed light source. Using spectral information to determine the values in the XYZ space and deriving the calculation described in the standard is the best way to estimate the value of the CCT and the CRI. In this work, we implement a method to classify light sources and to select an estimation model of the CRI and the CCT using a low cost RGB sensor. The model estimation has been developed in this work and a separated algorithm for each source type has been built. The results show that using a K-Nearest Neighbor classifier, the error resulted less than $3.6%$. The error of the model estimation for the LED was 1.8%, for fluorescent light sources 0.09% and 1.2% for incandescent light sources.

A Network-based Analysis of Ingredients Listsin Nutrient Profile Systems	CURRENT RESEARCH IN NUTRITION AND FOOD SCIENCE			English	Article						Consumer Health Informatics; Food Analysis; Food Composition; Food Database; Ingredient Network; Network Analysis; Nutrition Informatics	FOOD; KNOWLEDGE	It is well-established that diseases can be prevented or mitigated through dietary intervention, yet proper nutrition is one aspect consumers struggle to manage. Recent studies have shown that there are barriers to understanding the nutrition facts component of a food label which can be linked to dietary choices. In this work, we demonstrate reproducibility and replicability of a network-based method for automating the analysis of ingredients on a food product label en masse using the Open Food Facts Database and the USDA Food Data Central Branded Foods database in February 2020. Our results, which analyze the co-occurrence of 72,754 ingredients across show some consensus in labeling across FALCPA-regulated ingredients in food product labels across databases but highlight potential areas for discrepancy in consumer understanding and labeling practices for terms not subject to strict regulations. The key findings or contributions of this work include the provision of a reproducible method for quantifying the ingredients of packaged food in the United States across two nutritional profiling systems, and have identified 17 total ingredients that appear in the top 20 most co-occurring ingredients for both databases examined. We compare how of 8 FALCPA-regulated ingredients are represented in ingredients lists versus a common, but non-FALCPA regulated ingredient (corn), to demonstrate how one could examine differences between ingredient labeling between products. These findings suggest more research is needed in developing information systems to increase information available for consumers.

Mevalonic acid (MEV) is an important platform chemical for the biosynthesis of isoprenoids, and a building block in the synthesis of polymers. In our previous study, the growth and MEV production of AM1-dcel-mvt strain were found to be unstable in the culture media tested (CHOI, MP, MC and HP), which contained ammonium salts, magnesium, calcium, buffers, methanol and trace elements. In this study, we developed a novel MC medium based on MP and CHOI, which improved the growth rate and the reproducibility and replicability of culture process considerably. AM1-dcel-mvt cells cultivated in MC displayed a more homogenous doubling time than cells in other media, which could explain their more stable growth. The optimized MO medium containing a higher phosphate buffer concentration and lower trace elements was developed, which enhanced MEV production by 0.61 fold to 340 mg/L. In fed-batch fermentation in a 5 L fermenter, a MEV titre of 2.59 g/Land a dry cell weight (DCW) of 9.03 g/L were obtained, representing the highest MEV production reported to date for the AM1-dcel-mvt strain. The MO medium facilitate the stable growth of AM1, and improve the industrial-scale production of MEV. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Kim, JY; Cho, SB				Kim, Jin-Young; Cho, Sung-Bae			A systematic analysis and guidelines of graph neural networks for practical applications	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Graph neural network; Graph embedding; Deep learning; Graph classification; Social network analysis; Bioinformatics	GENERAL FRAMEWORK; PREDICTION	A graph neural network (GNN) draws attention to deal with many problems in social networks and bioinformatics, as graph data proliferate in a wide variety of applications. Despite the large amount of investigation, it is still difficult to choose the most suitable method for a given problem due to the lack of a thorough analysis on the feasible methods. An anatomical comparison of GNNs would help to devise a prospective method for better solution to real-world problems. In order to give guidelines to make full use of the GNN for graph classification, this paper attempts to analyze the state-of-the-art methods of the GNN and provide practicable guidelines for applications. The representative methods are described with a systematic scheme in four phases for GNN: 1) preprocessing, 2) aggregation, 3) readout, and 4) classification with graph embedding, resulting in a large coverage of more than 1300 methods. The 13 well-known benchmark datasets are categorized into three types with respect to the properties of graph data such as connectivity. In total, more than 3600 runs are executed to systematically analyze and compare the GNN models while changing only one method for each phase. Experimental reproducibility and replicability are also verified by comparing the results with the performance from the literature.

J	Smalheiser, NR; Graetz, EE; Yu, Z; Wang, J				Smalheiser, Neil R.; Graetz, Elena E.; Yu, Zhou; Wang, Jing			Effect size, sample size and power of forced swim test assays in mice: Guidelines for investigators to optimize reproducibility	PLOS ONE			English	Article							STATISTICAL POWER; VALIDITY; FAILURE	A recent flood of publications has documented serious problems in scientific reproducibility, power, and reporting of biomedical articles, yet scientists persist in their usual practices. Why? We examined a popular and important preclinical assay, the Forced Swim Test (FST) in mice used to test putative antidepressants. Whether the mice were assayed in a naive state vs. in a model of depression or stress, and whether the mice were given test agents vs. known antidepressants regarded as positive controls, the mean effect sizes seen in the experiments were indeed extremely large (1.5-2.5 in Cohen's d units); most of the experiments utilized 7-10 animals per group which did have adequate power to reliably detect effects of this magnitude. We propose that this may at least partially explain why investigators using the FST do not perceive intuitively that their experimental designs fall short-even though proper prospective design would require similar to 21-26 animals per group to detect, at a minimum, large effects (0.8 in Cohen's d units) when the true effect of a test agent is unknown. Our data provide explicit parameters and guidance for investigators seeking to carry out prospective power estimation for the FST. More generally, altering the real-life behavior of scientists in planning their experiments may require developing educational tools that allow them to actively visualize the inter-relationships among effect size, sample size, statistical power, and replicability in a direct and intuitive manner.

J	Abozaid, A; Tsang, B; Gerlai, R				Abozaid, Amira; Tsang, Benjamin; Gerlai, Robert			The effects of small but abrupt change in temperature on the behavior of larval zebrafish	PHYSIOLOGY & BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Zebrafish; Fear and anxiety; Locomotor behavior; Video-tracking; Environmental factors; Temperature; Replicability	FISH MACROPODUS-OPERCULARIS; DANIO-RERIO; VERTEBRATE; SALINITY; ENZYMES; SIZE	The zebrafish has become increasingly utilized in behavioral neuroscience, psychopharmacology, and behavior genetics research. However, little attention has been paid to the potential effects of environmental conditions fish are exposed to before and during behavioral testing. One such important factor is temperature, more specifically, the difference in temperature between holding and test tanks. In the current study, we bred and raised zebrafish of the AB strain in 28 degrees C water for 7 days until they were free swimming. On the 7th day we placed each experimental subject singly into the testing well with water set to 24 degrees C, 28 degrees C or 30 degrees C for 15 min and recorded the behavior of the subjects. We found significant and behavior-specific idiosyncratic effects of the employed temperature changes. For example, lowering the temperature decreased speed, but increasing the temperature did not alter it. Increased temperature reduced duration of immobility and reduced absolute turn angle, but lowered temperature did not alter these behaviors. While lowered temperature, and to a lesser degree also increased temperature, reduced intra-individual temporal variance of absolute turn angle. Furthermore, we found no change in thigmotaxis and frequency of immobility by either temperature change. Our results demonstrate the importance of temperature in behavioral studies with zebrafish and suggest that equating water temperature between holding and testing tanks is required to enhance reproducibility and replicability of results with this species.

Various radioactive and non-radioactive cytotoxicity assays measuring target cell death have been developed. Among these methods, the most commonly used (51)Chromium-release assay (CRA) and flow cytometry-based cytotoxicity assays (FCCs) are the major representatives. Nonetheless, several drawbacks, including dye leakage and the potential effects of prior labeling on cells, curb the broad applicability of the FCCs. MethodsHere, we report a rapid FCC for quantifying target cell death after co-incubation with NK cells. In this assay, after 4 hours of NK cell-target cell co-incubation, fluorochrome-conjugated CD2 antibody was used to identify NK cells, and SYTOX Green and Annexin V-FITC were further used to detect target cell death in CD2-negative population. In parallel, both CRA and FCC assay using CFSE/ 7-AAD were performed to validate the reproducibility and replicability. ResultsWe observed that CD2 is exclusively positive on NK cells other than the most common hematological target tumor cells, such as K562, HL60, MOLM13, Raji, NCI-H929, rpmi8226, MM.1S, and KMS11. Assessment of target cell death using the CD2-based FCC shows a significantly higher percent specific lysis of the target cells compared to the standard CRA and the FCC assay using CFSE and 7-AAD. ConclusionsWe demonstrated that this CD2-based FCC is a fast, simple, and reliable method for evaluating NK cell cytotoxicity.

Applicability of 3D-dental reconstruction in cervical odontometrics	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY			English	Article						computed tomography; dental cervical measurements; three-dimensional	ARCHAEOLOGICAL BONE; HISTOLOGICAL DETERMINATION; DIAGENETIC ALTERATION; MICROBIAL ATTACK; HUMAN-ORIGIN; SITES; PRESERVATION; MICROSCOPY; FRAGMENTS; REMAINS	Objectives: The objective of this study was to assess the accuracy, reliability, and reproducibility of computed tomography (CT) images in measuring cervical mesiodistal and buccolingual tooth sizes, by comparing the values obtained by 3D virtual models from CT images with those obtained using digital calipers. Materials and methods: In total, 530 maxillary and mandibular teeth of 51 individuals from two Iron Age sites were scanned using a Siemens Somatom sensation 64-slice computed tomography machine, and the images were reconstructed and measured. Values obtained by direct measurement served as the primary reference for cervical measurements. Intra-and inter-observer reliability was assessed by calculating technical error of measurements (TEM), relative technical error of measurements (rTEM), and the coefficient of reliability (R). Results: Results showed that virtual cervical measurements were not significantly different from the actual measurements, and the correlation of the two measurement methods shows that the methods are comparable. Inter-and intra-observer error analysis also indicated high replicability of measurements with both measuring methods (R > 0.99). The rTEM values for all the measurements were below the 5% standards for anthropometric studies. Discussion: CT is a non-invasive technique that allows for an accurate and detailed visualization of morphological features without causing any damage to teeth. Our findings indicate that virtual odontometric analysis is a reliable method, similar to traditional physical odontometric analysis. Currently, the virtual system is likely to be more suitable for fragile specimens, such as archaeological samples.

This study aims at elevating the accuracy of the empirical validation of the CI construct suggested and confirmed by Madureira, Popovic and Castelli to serve as the scientific foundation for CI praxis. This construct is selected due to its unmatched recency, thoroughness, universality identified limitations of its empirical validation. We relied on a multistrand design of fully sequential with equivalent status qualitative and quantitative mix-methods followed by the triangulation of the findings and the development of the meta-inferences. Validity, reliability and applicability were tested using computer-aided text analysis and artificial intelligence methods based on 61 in-depth interviews with CI subject matter experts. Contributions to knowledge advancement and relevance to practice derive from the scientific-grade empirical construct validation, providing undisputed levels of accuracy, consistency, applicability, and triangulation of results. This study highlights three critical implications. First, the delimitation of the body of knowledge and recognition of the CI domain serve as the baseline for theory development. Second, the validated construct guarantees reproducibility, replicability and generalisability, laying the foundations for establishing CI science, practice and education. Third, creating a common language and shared understanding will drive the much-claimed definitional consensus. This study thus stands as a foundational pillar in supporting CI praxis in improving decision-making quality and the performance of organisations.

Directional and colour preference in maze tasks	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						behaviour; colour; direction; preference; sex differences; zebrafish	ANXIETY-RELATED BEHAVIOR; ADULT ZEBRAFISH; DANIO-RERIO; PLUS-MAZE; MODELS; MEMORY; SEX; AGGRESSION	Studies regarding the animals' innate preferences help elucidate and avoid probable sources of bias and serve as a reference to improve and develop new behavioural tasks. In zebrafish research, data obtained in behavioural assessments are often not replicated between research groups or even inside the same laboratory raising huge concerns about replicability and reproducibility. Among the potential causes that are not well considered, sexual differences can be a probable source of bias. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the male and female zebrafish directional and colour preferences in the plus-maze and T-maze behavioural tasks. Experiment 1 evaluated directional preference, and experiment 2 evaluated colour preference in a plus-maze task; experiment 3 evaluated preference between black or white in a T-maze task. Individual preferences were expressed as the percentage of time spent in each zone. Our results showed that male and female zebrafish demonstrated no difference in directional preference in the plus-maze task. Surprisingly, male and female zebrafish showed colour preference differences in the plus-maze task; males did not show any colour preference, while female zebrafish demonstrated a red preference compared to white, blue and yellow colours. Moreover, both male and female zebrafish demonstrated a strong black colour preference compared to the white colour in the T-maze task. Our findings characterized the spontaneous preference of male and female zebrafish for direction and colour, identifying possible biases and providing insights that contribute to the standardization of future protocols.

This could potentially introduce artefactual changes or mask pathological alterations. However, if and how changes of MRI hardware, scanning protocols or preprocessing software affect complex neuroimaging outcomes from, e.g., diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) remains largely understudied. We therefore compared DWI outcomes and artefact severity of 121 healthy participants (age range 19-54 years) who underwent two matched DWI protocols (Siemens product and Center for Magnetic Resonance Research sequence) at two sites (Siemens 3T Magnetom Verio and Skyra(fit)). After different preprocessing steps, fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) maps, obtained by tensor fitting, were processed with tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS). Inter-scanner and inter-sequence variability of skeletonised FA values reached up to 5% and differed largely in magnitude and direction across the brain. Skeletonised MD values differed up to 14% between scanners. We here demonstrate that DTI outcome measures strongly depend on imaging site and software, and that these biases vary between brain regions. These regionally inhomogeneous biases may exceed and considerably confound physiological effects such as ageing, highlighting the need to harmonise data acquisition and analysis. Future studies thus need to implement novel strategies to augment neuroimaging data reliability and replicability.

J	Holmes, S				Holmes, Susan			STATISTICAL PROOF? THE PROBLEM OF IRREPRODUCIBILITY	BULLETIN OF THE AMERICAN MATHEMATICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							FALSE DISCOVERY RATE; POST-SELECTION INFERENCE; HIGHER CRITICISM; REPRODUCIBLE RESEARCH; MULTIPLE; REGRESSION; TESTS; FAILURE; POWER	Data currently generated in the fields of ecology, medicine, climatology, and neuroscience often contain tens of thousands of measured variables. If special care is not taken, the complexity associated with statistical analysis of such data can lead to publication of results that prove to be irreproducible. The field of modern statistics has had to revisit the classical hypothesis testing paradigm to accommodate modern high-throughput settings. A first step is correction for multiplicity in the number of possible variables selected as significant using multiple hypotheses correction to ensure false discovery rate (FDR) control (Benjamini, Hochberg, 1995). FDR adjustments do not solve the problem of double dipping the data, and recent work develops a field known as post-selection inference that enables inference when the same data is used both to choose and to evaluate models. It remains that the complexity of software and flexibility of choices in tuning parameters can bias the output toward inflation of significant results; neuro-scientists recently revisited the problem and found that many fMRI studies have resulted in false positives. Unfortunately, all formal correction methods are tailored for specific settings and do not take into account the flexibility available to today's statisticians. A constructive way forward is to be transparent about the analyses performed, separate the exploratory and confirmatory phases of the analyses, and provide open access code; this will result in both enhanced reproducibility and replicability.

J	Gentile, V				Gentile, Valerio			Reconstruct the unknown, replicate the uncontrollable. Current issues in the experimental archaeology of combat	JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE-REPORTS			English	Article						Experimental archaeology; Metalwork wear analysis; Combat experiments; Bronze Age; Weapons	SWORDS; WEAR	Following the so-called material turn, in archaeology much attention is devoted to the affective response to objects, the physical affordances of items, or the agency of materials on one another. However, such aspects have been partially overlooked in experimental use wear research. Issues surrounding contact material selection and its degree of representativity against the larger archaeological sample are some of the problems that a well-considered approach in experimental archaeology and wear analysis should take into account. These problems are inherently linked with the discussion over controlled lab experiments vs actualistic layouts: one of the most contentious debates in experimental archaeology. More broadly, these issues are further tied to the crisis of confidence in experimental results and issues such as replicability and reproducibility. These concerns are even more significant in research attempting to simulate and investigate combat wear traces, where these problems also intertwine with the challenges that these layouts pose in terms of best practices to follow to ensure ethics and sustainability. In this paper, the methodological framework implemented in two experimental campaigns studying prehistoric bronze weaponry is discussed. The examples are then used to illustrate some of the chal-lenges in these types of set-ups and to provide discussion points regarding potential solutions. In addition, steps to take in order to increase confidence in the interpretation of experimental results are proposed. While repli-cation of experimental results is paramount, it is also necessary to reduce the ambiguity of experimental results.

However, given the large variety of such tasks in the literature, choosing the most suitable architecture for each use case is difficult. This work aims to facilitate this task by reviewing various state-of-the-art deep learning (DL) architectures and analysing how well they integrate with predictive maintenance stages to meet industrial companies' requirements from a PdM perspective. This review includes a self-organising map (SOM), one-class neural network (OC-NN) and generative techniques. This article explains how to adapt DL architectures to facilitate data variability handling, model adaptability and ensemble learning, all of which are characteristics relevant to industrial requirements. In addition, this review compares the results of state-of-the-art DL architectures on a publicly available dataset to facilitate reproducibility and replicability, enabling comparisons. Furthermore, this work covers the mitigation step with deep learning models, the final PdM stage that is essential for implementing PdM systems. Moreover, state-of-the-art deep learning architectures are categorised, analysed and compared; their industrial applications are presented; and an explanation of how to combine different architectures in a solution is presented that addresses their gaps. Finally, open challenges and possible future research paths are presented and supported in this review, and current research trends are identified.

J	Belikov, AV; Rzhetsky, A; Evans, J				Belikov, Alexander, V; Rzhetsky, Andrey; Evans, James			Prediction of robust scientific facts from literature	NATURE MACHINE INTELLIGENCE			English	Article							CONCEPTUAL REPLICATION; SCIENCE; GENERATION; KNOWLEDGE; IMPACT; TEAMS	The growth of published science in recent years has escalated the difficulty that human and algorithmic agents face in reasoning over prior knowledge to select the next experiment. This challenge is increased by uncertainty about the reproducibility of published findings. The availability of massive digital archives, machine reading, extraction tools and automated high-throughput experiments allows us to evaluate these challenges computationally at scale and identify novel opportunities to craft policies that accelerate scientific progress. Here we demonstrate a Bayesian calculus that enables positive prediction of robust scientific claims with findings extracted from published literature, weighted by scientific, social and institutional factors demonstrated to increase replicability. Illustrated with the case of gene regulatory interactions, our approach automatically estimates and counteracts sources of bias, revealing that scientifically focused but socially and institutionally diverse research activity is most likely to replicate. This results in updated certainty about the literature, which accurately predicts robust scientific facts on which new experiments should build. Our findings allow us to identify and evaluate policy recommendations for scientific institutions that may increase robust scientific knowledge, including sponsorship of increased diversity of and independence between investigations of any particular scientific phenomenon, and diversity of scientific phenomena investigated. With the availability of a vast and growing number of digital publications, machine reading and other knowledge mining tools, computational methods can be applied at scale to extract insights from the scientific literature. Belikov et al. develop a Bayesian method to mine the biomedical literature that identifies robust scientific findings which could improve the planning of further experiments and scientific investigation.

Research tool for classifying Gulf War illness using survey responses: Lessons for writing replicable algorithms for symptom-based conditions	LIFE SCIENCES			English	Article						Case definition classification; Reusable code; Chronic multi-symptom illness; Veterans; Gulf War illness	VETERANS; EXPOSURES; HEALTH	Aims: Gulf War illness (GWI), a chronic symptom-based disorder, affects up to 30% of Veterans who served in the 1990-1991 Gulf War1. Because no diagnostic test or code for GWI exists, researchers typically determine case status using self-reported symptoms and conditions according to Kansas2 and CDC3 criteria. No validated algorithm has been published and case definitions have varied slightly by study. This paper aims to standardize the application of the original CDC and Kansas case definitions by defining a framework for writing reliable code for complex case definitions, implementing this framework on a sample of 1343 Gulf War Veterans (GWVs), and validating the framework by applying the code to a sample of 41,077 GWVs. Main methods: Methods were drawn from software engineering: write pseudocode, write test cases, and write code; then test code. Code was examined for accuracy, flexibility, replicability, and reusability. Key findings: The pseudocode promoted understanding of the planned algorithm, encouraging discussion and leading to agreement on the case definition algorithms among all team members. The completed SAS code was written for and tested in the Gulf War Era Cohort and Biorepository (GWECB)4. This code was adapted and tested in the Million Veteran Program (MVP)5. The code was documented for reproducibility and reusability. Significance: Ease of reuse suggests that this method could be used to standardize the application of other case definitions, reducing time and resources spent by each study team. Documentation, code, and test cases are available through the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Phenomics catalog6.

Novel organotypic microphysiological in vitro models are being developed to replicate the contractile function of skeletal muscle; however, the throughput and a need for specialized equipment may limit the utility of these tissue chip models for screening. In addition, recent developments in stem cell biology have resulted in the generation of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived skeletal myoblasts that enable high-throughput in vitro screening. This study set out to develop a high-throughput multiplexed assay using iPSC-derived skeletal myoblasts that can be used as a first-pass screen to assess the potential for chemicals to affect skeletal muscle. We found that cytotoxicity and cytoskeletal integrity are most useful and reproducible assays for the skeletal myoblasts when evaluating overall cellular health or gauging disruptions in actin polymerization following 24h of exposure. Both assays are based on high-content imaging and quantitative image processing to derive quantitative phenotypes. Both assays showed good to excellent assay robustness and reproducibility measured by interplate and interday replicability, coefficients of variation of negative controls, and Z'-factors for positive control chemicals. Concentration response assessment of muscle-related toxicants showed specificity of the observed effects compared to the general cytotoxicity. Overall, this study establishes a high-throughput multiplexed assay using skeletal myoblasts that may be used for screening and prioritization of chemicals for more complex tissue chip-based and in vivo evaluation.

J	Dunlop, RA; Banack, SA; Cox, PA				Dunlop, Rachael Anne; Banack, Sandra Anne; Cox, Paul Alan			L1CAM immunocapture generates a unique extracellular vesicle population with a reproducible miRNA fingerprint	RNA BIOLOGY			English	Article						Exosome; neural-enriched; reproducibility; amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS); biomarker; L1CAM	CELL; MICRORNAS; PLASMA; SERUM	Micro RNAs (miRNAs) are short, non-coding RNAs with significant potential as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. However, a lack of reproducibility across studies has hindered their introduction into clinical settings. Inconsistencies between studies include a lack of consensus on the miRNAs associated with a specific disease and the direction of regulation. These differences may reflect the heterogenous nature of pathologies with multiple phenotypes, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). It is also possible that discrepancies are due to different sampling, processing, and analysis protocols across labs. Using miRNA extracted from L1CAM immunoaffinity purified extracellular vesicles (neural-enriched extracellular vesicles or NEE), we thrice replicated an 8-miRNA fingerprint diagnostic of ALS, which includes the miRNA species and direction of regulation. We aimed to determine if the extra purification steps required to generate NEE created a unique extracellular vesicle (EV) fraction that might contribute to the robustness and replicability of our assay. We compared three fractions from control human plasma: 1) total heterogenous EVs (T), 2) L1CAM/neural enriched EVs (NEE), and 3) the remaining total-minus-NEE fraction (T-N). Each fraction was characterized for size, total protein content, and protein markers, then total RNA was extracted, and qPCR was run on 20 miRNAs. We report that the miRNA expression within NEE was different enough compared to T and T-N to justify the extra steps required to generate this fraction.

In the present study, we establish an approach to study the genetic structure patterns of two European hedgehog species Erinaceaus europaeus and E. roumanicus. These species are usually associated with human settlements and are good models to study anthropogenic impacts on the genetic diversity of wild populations. The short sequence repeats genotyping by sequence (SSR-GBS) method presented uses amplicon sequences to determine genotypes for which allelic variants can be defined according to both length and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). To evaluate whether complete sequence information improved genetic structure definition, we compared this information with datasets based solely on length information. We identified a total of 42 markers which were successfully amplified in both species. Overall, genotyping based on complete sequence information resulted in a higher number of alleles, as well as greater genetic diversity and differentiation between species. Additionally, the structure patterns were slightly clearer with a division between both species and some potential hybrids. There was some degree of genetic structure within species, although only in E. roumanicus was this related to geographical distance. The statistically significant results obtained by SSR-GBS demonstrate that it is superior to electrophoresis-based methods for SSR genotyping. Moreover, the greater reproducibility and throughput with lower effort which can be obtained with SSR-GBS and the possibility to include degraded DNA into the analysis, allow for continued relevance of SSR markers during the genomic era.

However, reproducibility and replicability are not sufficient: an incorrect result will be accurately reproduced if the same incorrect methods are used. For the field of simulations of complex neural networks, the causes of incorrect results vary from insufficient model implementations and data analysis methods, deficiencies in workmanship (e.g., simulation planning, setup, and execution) to errors induced by hardware constraints (e.g., limitations in numerical precision). In order to build credibility, methods such as verification and validation have been developed, but they are not yet well-established in the field of neural network modeling and simulation, partly due to ambiguity concerning the terminology. In this manuscript, we propose a terminology for model verification and validation in the field of neural network modeling and simulation. We outline a rigorous workflow derived from model verification and validation methodologies for increasing model credibility when it is not possible to validate against experimental data. We compare a published minimal spiking network model capable of exhibiting the development of polychronous groups, to its reproduction on the SpiNNaker neuromorphic system, where we consider the dynamics of several selected network states. As a result, by following a formalized process, we show that numerical accuracy is critically important, and even small deviations in the dynamics of individual neurons are expressed in the dynamics at network level.

J	Donnini, M; Marchesini, I; Zucchini, A				Donnini, Marco; Marchesini, Ivan; Zucchini, Azzurra			A new Alpine geo-lithological map (Alpine-Geo-LiM) and global carbon cycle implications	GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA BULLETIN			English	Article							DISSOLVED ORGANIC-CARBON; CO2 CONSUMPTION; ATMOSPHERIC CO2; STRUCTURAL EVOLUTION; VOLCANIC-ROCKS; FORELAND BASIN; REVISED MODEL; EUROPEAN ALPS; RIVER; GEOCHEMISTRY	The chemical composition of river waters gives a measure of the atmospheric CO2 fixed by chemical weathering processes. Since the dominating factors controlling these processes are lithology and runoff, as well as uplift and erosion, we introduce a new simplified geo-lithological map of the Alps (Alpine-Geo-LiM) that adopted a lithological classification compliant with the methods most used in literature for estimating the consumption of atmospheric CO2 by chemical weathering. The map was used together with published alkalinity data of the 33 main Alpine rivers (1) to investigate the relationship between bicarbonate concentration in the sampled waters and the lithologies of the corresponding drained basins, and (2) to quantify the atmospheric CO2 consumed by chemical weathering. The analyses confirm (as known by the literature) that carbonates are lithologies highly prone to consuming atmospheric CO2. Moreover, the analyses show that sandstone (which could have a nonnegligible carbonate component) plays an important role in consuming atmospheric CO2. Another result is that in multilithological basins containing lithologies more prone to consuming atmospheric CO2, the contribution of igneous rocks to the atmospheric CO2 consumption is negligible. Alpine-Geo-LiM has several novel features when compared with published global lithological maps. One novel feature is due to the attention paid in discriminating metamorphic rocks, which were classified according to the chemistry of protoliths. The second novel feature is that the procedure used for the definition of the map was made available on the Web to allow the replicability and reproducibility of the product.

Temporal dissociation of phencyclidine: Induced locomotor and social alterations in rats using an automated homecage monitoring system - implications for the 3Rs and preclinical drug discovery	JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Homecage; welfare; locomotor activity; social interactions; refinement; phencyclidine; schizophrenia; autism	INDUCED STEREOTYPED BEHAVIOR; NEGATIVE SYMPTOMS; SCHIZOPHRENIA; DEFICITS; MODELS; MICE; DISRUPTION; PCP; ENVIRONMENT; WITHDRAWAL	Background: Rodent behavioural assays are widely used to delineate the mechanisms of psychiatric disorders and predict the efficacy of drug candidates. Conventional behavioural paradigms are restricted to short time windows and involve transferring animals from the homecage to unfamiliar apparatus which induces stress. Additionally, factors including environmental perturbations, handling and the presence of an experimenter can impact behaviour and confound data interpretation. To improve welfare and reproducibility these issues must be resolved. Automated homecage monitoring offers a more ethologically relevant approach with reduced experimenter bias. Aim: To evaluate the effectiveness of an automated homecage system at detecting locomotor and social alterations induced by phencyclidine (PCP) in group-housed rats. PCP is an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist commonly utilised to model aspects of schizophrenia. Methods: Rats housed in groups of three were implanted with radio frequency identification (RFID) tags. Each homecage was placed over a RFID reader baseplate for the automated monitoring of the social and locomotor activity of each individual rat. For all rats, we acquired homecage data for 24 h following administration of both saline and PCP (2.5 mg/kg). Results: PCP resulted in significantly increased distance travelled from 15 to 60 min post injection. Furthermore, PCP significantly enhanced time spent isolated from cage mates and this asociality occured from 60 to 105 min post treatment. Conclusions: Unlike conventional assays, in-cage monitoring captures the temporal duration of drug effects on multiple behaviours in the same group of animals. This approach could benefit psychiatric preclinical drug discovery through improved welfare and increased between-laboratory replicability.

Animal models enable the exploration of such connections with prospective, well-controlled study designs. However, with the recent awareness of replicability issues in preclinical research, the reproducibility of results from animal models has been highlighted. The present study aims to reproduce the behavioral effects of maternal separation (MS) previously observed in the multivariate concentric square field(TM) (MCSF) test. A second objective was to replicate the adolescent behavioral profiles previously described in the MCSF test. Male rats, subjected to short or prolonged MS or standard rearing, were subjected to behavioral testing in early adolescence and early adulthood. As seen in previous studies, the behavioral effects of MS in the MCSF were small at both tested time points. When tested in early adolescence, the animals exhibited a similar behavioral profile as previously seen, and the finding of adolescent behavioral types was also reproduced. The distribution of animals into the behavioral types was different than in the initial study, but in a manner consistent with developmental theories, as the current cohort was younger than the previous. Notably, the Shelter seeker behavioral type persisted through development, while the Explorer type did not. The lack of basal behavioral effect after MS is in line with the literature on this MS paradigm; the working hypothesis is that the prolonged MS gives rise to a phenotype predisposed to negative health outcomes but which is not apparent without additional provocation.

The aim of this study was to use an MCDA to assess the value of dupilumab for severe atopic dermatitis compared with secukinumab for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in Spain. Method Following the EVIDEM (Evidence and Value: Impact on DEcision Making) methodology, the estimated value of both interventions was obtained by means of an additive linear model that combined the individual weighting (between 1 and 5) of each criterion with the individual scoring of each intervention in each criterion. Dupilumab was evaluated against placebo, while secukinumab was evaluated against placebo, etanercept and ustekinumab. A retest was performed to assess the reproducibility of weights, scores and value estimates. Results The overall MCDA value estimate for dupilumab versus placebo was 0.51 +/- 0.14. This value was higher than those obtained for secukinumab: 0.48 +/- 0.15 versus placebo, 0.45 +/- 0.15 versus etanercept and 0.39 +/- 0.18 versus ustekinumab. The highest-value contribution was reported by the patients' group, followed by the clinical professionals and the decision makers. A fundamental element that explained the difference in the scoring between pathologies was the availability of therapeutic alternatives. The retest confirmed the consistency and replicability of the analysis. Conclusions Under this methodology, and assuming similar economic costs per patient for both treatments, the results indicated that the overall value estimated of dupilumab for severe atopic dermatitis was similar to, or slightly higher than, that of secukinumab for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.

The present study reveals 1 such variable, the individual differences in affective response to chronic injection stress, by using the novelty-seeking phenotype as a model of differential emotional reactivity. The phenotype is identified by exposing a population of experimentally naive outbred rats to the mild stress of a novel environment and classifying them as high responders (HR; upper 1/3) and low responders (LR; lower 1/3) based on their locomotor reactivity. Research has shown that HR/LR animals differ in their basal levels of anxiety-and depressive-like behavior, as well as in their response to environmental and pharmacological challenges; suggesting validity of this model in studying individual differences in stress reactivity. The present data showed that 14 daily, intraperitoneal saline injections did not alter the phenotypic differences in social behavior observed basally in HR/LR rats. However, injections significantly increased time spent immobile in the forced swim test in HRs, while the identical regimen significantly decreased the same measure in LRs, compared with handled-controls. These data indicate that individual differences in stress reactivity can have a significant impact on the depressive-like responses to repeated intraperitoneal injections in rats. Given that such underlying emotional variability exists within standard, outbred rat populations, this study highlights the importance of accounting for such variability in any study investigating the effects of repeated drug administration on depressive-like behavior for reliability and replicability of findings. Thus, we recommend including an uninjected control group in all studies.

Preregistration of the hypotheses and methods of an empirical study before analysis, the sharing of primary research data, and compliance with data standards such as the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS), are considered effective practices to secure progress and to substantiate quality of research. We investigated the current level of adoption of open science practices in neuroimaging and the difficulties that prevent researchers from using them. Email invitations to participate in the survey were sent to addresses received through a PubMed search of human functional magnetic resonance imaging studies that were published between 2010 and 2020. 283 persons completed the questionnaire. Although half of the participants were experienced with preregistration, the willingness to preregister studies in the future was modest. The majority of participants had experience with the sharing of primary neuroimaging data. Most of the participants were interested in implementing a standardized data structure such as BIDS in their labs. Based on demographic variables, we compared participants on seven subscales, which had been generated through factor analysis. Exploratory analyses found that experienced researchers at lower career level had higher fear of being transparent and researchers with residence in the EU had a higher need for data governance. Additionally, researchers at medical faculties as compared to other university faculties reported a more unsupportive supervisor with regards to open science practices and a higher need for data governance. The results suggest growing adoption of open science practices but also highlight a number of important impediments.

The objective of this exercise was to convert the Scottish Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) Policy Model from Excel to R and discuss the lessons learnt throughout this process. The CVD model is a competing risk state transition cohort model. Four health economists, with varied experience of R, attempted to replicate an identical model structure in R based on the model in Excel and reproduce the intermediate and final results. Replications varied in their use of specialist health economics packages in addition to standard data management packages. Two versions of the CVD model were created in R along with a Shiny app. Version 1 was developed without health economics specialist packages and produced identical results to the Excel version. Version 2 used the heemod package and did not achieve the same results, possibly due to the non-standard elements of the model and limited time to adapt the functions. The R model requires less than half the computational time than the Excel model. Conversion of the spreadsheet models to script models is feasible for health economists. A step-by-step guide for the conversion process is provided and modellers' experience is discussed. Coding without specialist packages allows full flexibility, while specialist packages may add convenience if the model structure is suitable. Whichever approach is taken, transparency and replicability remain the key criteria in model programming. Model conversions must maintain standards in these areas regardless of the choice of software.

Can the measured angle ABC on the lateral projection of the knee be used to determine the tube angulation for an optimum skyline projection?	RADIOGRAPHY			English	Article						Skyline view; Lateral knee radiograph; Skyline angulation	RADIOGRAPHS	Introduction: The current technique of angulating for a skyline knee projection relies heavily on the radiographer's estimation of the patella tilt, rendering it subjective and prone to errors. This study therefore aims to (i) examine the correlation between angle ABC measured on the lateral X-ray image and skyline angulation (measured in degrees) and (ii) determine the inter-rater reliability of angle ABC measurements. Methods: 145 sets of lateral and skyline X-ray images from patients aged 40-70 years old were retrospectively analysed. Angle ABC was measured using prominent landmarks such as the trochlear sulcus, tibial tuberosity and the anterior border of the patella on the lateral knee radiograph. It was then retrospectively compared with the skyline tube angulations to identify any correlation between the two. An inter-rater reliability test was also conducted using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) to determine the reproducibility of the measurement method. Results: A weak correlation was found between angle ABC and skyline angulation (r = 0.1, p = 0.25). The proposed method of measurement shows good inter-rater reliability (ICC = 0.81, 95% CI: 0.77 to 0.84). Conclusion: There is insufficient evidence to indicate a correlation between angle ABC and skyline angulation. However, angle ABC can be reliably measured, implying the replicability of the measurement method for other purposes. Implications for practice: The proposed measurement method of angle ABC on the lateral view could have future applications in other areas such as in the measurement of patellofemoral alignment and trochlear morphology.

Reproducibility in Cancer Biology: Challenges for assessing replicability in preclinical cancer biology	ELIFE			English	Article							RAF INHIBITORS; PUBLICATION DECISIONS; THERAPEUTIC TARGET; INCREASING VALUE; REDUCING WASTE; COLON-CANCER; STEM-CELLS; TUMOR; REPLICATION; SCIENCE	We conducted the Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology to investigate the replicability of preclinical research in cancer biology. The initial aim of the project was to repeat 193 experiments from 53 high-impact papers, using an approach in which the experimental protocols and plans for data analysis had to be peer reviewed and accepted for publication before experimental work could begin. However, the various barriers and challenges we encountered while designing and conducting the experiments meant that we were only able to repeat 50 experiments from 23 papers. Here we report these barriers and challenges. First, many original papers failed to report key descriptive and inferential statistics: the data needed to compute effect sizes and conduct power analyses was publicly accessible for just 4 of 193 experiments. Moreover, despite contacting the authors of the original papers, we were unable to obtain these data for 68% of the experiments. Second, none of the 193 experiments were described in sufficient detail in the original paper to enable us to design protocols to repeat the experiments, so we had to seek clarifications from the original authors. While authors were extremely or very helpful for 41% of experiments, they were minimally helpful for 9% of experiments, and not at all helpful (or did not respond to us) for 32% of experiments. Third, once experimental work started, 67% of the peer-reviewed protocols required modifications to complete the research and just 41% of those modifications could be implemented. Cumulatively, these three factors limited the number of experiments that could be repeated. This experience draws attention to a basic and fundamental concern about replication - it is hard to assess whether reported findings are credible.

Methods Four health economic obesity models simulating an adult UK population were identified, selected for replication, and evaluated using the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) checklist. Reproduction results were compared to original results, focusing on cost-effectiveness outcomes, and the resulting reproduction success was assessed by published criteria. Replication facilitators and hurdles were identified and transferred into related reporting standards. Results All four case studies were state-transition models simulating costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Comparing original versus reproduction outcomes, the following deviation ranges were observed: costs - 3.9 to 16.1% (mean over all model simulations 3.78%), QALYs - 3.7 to 2.1% (mean - 0.11%), and average cost-utility ratios - 3.0 to 17.9% (mean 4.28%). Applying different published criteria, an overall reproduction success was observed for three of four models. Key replication facilitators were input data tables and model diagrams, while missing standard deviations and missing formulas for equations were considered as key hurdles. Conclusions This study confirms the feasibility of rebuilding health economic obesity models, but minor to major assumptions were needed to fill reporting gaps. Model replications can help to assess the quality of health economic model documentation and can be used to validate current model reporting practices. Simple changes to actual CHEERS reporting criteria may solve identified replication hurdles.

J	Chintala, S; Dutta, R; Tadmor, D				Chintala, Srikar; Dutta, Ritvik; Tadmor, Doron			COVID-19 spatiotemporal research with workflow-based data analysis	INFECTION GENETICS AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						COVID-19; Coronavirus; Dynamic maps; KNIME; Spatial visualization; Visual analysis		Given the pertinence and acceleration of the spread of COVID-19, there is an increased need for the replicability of data models to verify the veracity of models and visualize important data. Most of these visualizations lack reproducibility, credibility, or accuracy, and are static, which makes it difficult to analyze the spread over time. Furthermore, most current visualizations depicting the spread of COVID-19 are at a global or country level, meaning there is a dearth of regional analysis within a country. Keeping these issues in mind, a replicable, efficient, and simple method to generate regional COVID-19 visualizations mapped with time was created by using the KNIME software, an open-source data analytics platform that can create user-friendly applications or workflows. For this analysis, Albania, Sweden, Ukraine, Denmark, Russia, India, and Australia were closely observed. Among the maps generated for the aforementioned countries, it was noticed that regions with a high population or high population density were often the epicenters within their respective country. The regions caused the virus to spread to their neighboring regions: kickstarting the "domino effect", leading to the infection of another region until the country is overwhelmed with cases-what we call a proximity trend. These dynamic maps are crucial to fighting the pandemic because they can provide insight as to how COVID-19 spreads by providing researchers or officials with an accurate and insightful tool to aid their analysis. By being able to visualize the spread, health and government officials can dive deeper to identify the sources of transmission and attempt to stop or reverse them accordingly.

In this type of buoyancy controlled flames, the soot content produced and their subsequent thermal radiation feedback to the pool surface are key to determine the self-sustainability of the flame, their mass burning rate and the heat release rate. The accurate characterization of these flames is an involved task, specially for modelers due to the difficulty of imposing adequate boundary conditions. For this reason, efforts are being made to design experimental campaigns with well-controlled conditions for their reliable repeatability, reproducibility and replicability. In this work, we characterized the production of soot in a surrogate pool fire. This is emulated by a bench-scale porous burner fueled with pure ethylene burning in still air. The flame stability was characterized with high temporal and spatial resolution by using a CMOS camera and a fast photodiode. The results show that the flame exhibit a time-varying propagation behavior with a periodic separation of the reactive zone. Soot volume fraction distributions were measured at nine locations along the flame centerline from 20 to 100 mm above the burner exit using the auto-compensating laser-induced incandescence (AC-LII) technique. The mean, standard deviation and probability density function of soot volume fraction were determined. Soot volume fraction presents an increasing tendency with the height above the burner, in spite of a local decrease at 90 mm which is approximately the position separating the lower and attached portion of the flame from the higher more intermittent one. The results of this work provide a valuable data set for validating soot production models in pool fire configurations.

Possible reasons for the lack of translation of the results observed in preclinical research into human clinical benefit include the design, conduct, and reporting of preclinical studies. There is currently no formal domain-based assessment of the clinical relevance of preclinical research. To address this issue, we have developed a tool for the assessment of the clinical relevance of preclinical studies, with the intention of assessing the likelihood that therapeutic preclinical findings can be translated into improvement in the management of human diseases. Methods: We searched the EQUATOR network for guidelines that describe the design, conduct, and reporting of preclinical research. We searched the references of these guidelines to identify further relevant publications and developed a set of domains and signalling questions. We then conducted a modified Delphi-consensus to refine and develop the tool. The Delphi panel members included specialists in evidence-based (preclinical) medicine specialists, methodologists, preclinical animal researchers, a veterinarian, and clinical researchers. A total of 20 Delphi-panel members completed the first round and 17 members from five countries completed all three rounds. Results: This tool has eight domains construct validity, external validity, risk of bias, experimental design and data analysis plan, reproducibility and replicability of methods and results in the same model, research integrity, and research transparency) and a total of 28 signalling questions and provides a framework for researchers, journal editors, grant funders, and regulatory authorities to assess the potential clinical relevance of preclinical animal research. Conclusion: We have developed a tool to assess the clinical relevance of preclinical studies. This tool is currently being piloted.

However, a thorough understanding of the mechanisms governing helminth-microbiota interactions and of their impact on host health and welfare relies on reproducibility and replicability of findings. To this aim, in this study, we analysed quantitative and qualitative fluctuations in the faecal microbiota composition of lambs vaccinated against, and experimentally infected with, the parasitic GI nematode Teladorsagia circumcincta over the course of two separate trials performed over two consecutive years. Methods Two trials were conducted under similar experimental conditions in 2017 and 2018, respectively. In each trial, lambs were randomly assigned to one of the following experimental groups: (i) vaccinated/infected, (ii) unvaccinated/infected and (iii) unvaccinated/uninfected. Faecal samples collected from individual animals were subjected to DNA extraction followed by high-throughput sequencing of the V3-V4 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene and bioinformatics and biostatistical analyses of sequence data. Results Substantial differences in the populations of bacteria affected by immunisation against and infection by T. circumcincta were detected when comparing data from the two trials. Nevertheless, the abundance of Prevotella spp. was significantly linked to helminth infection in both trials. Conclusions Despite the largely conflicting findings between the two trials, our data revealed that selected gut microbial populations are consistently affected by T. circumcincta infection and/or vaccination. Nevertheless, our study calls for caution when interpreting data generated from in vivo helminth-microbiome interaction studies that may be influenced by several intrinsic and extrinsic host-, parasite- and environment-related factors.

Improved FBX chemical dosimeter system with enhanced radiochemical yield for reference dosimetry in radiobiology and radiotherapy research	RADIATION PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY			English	Article						FBX chemical dosimeter; PMMA slab Phantom; Enhanced radiochemical yield; Reference dosimetry	XYLENOL ORANGE; RADIATION-CHEMISTRY; ACID; CO-60	Radiation dosimetry plays important role in the reproducibility of radiobiology experiments, in the replicability of results, as well as in the successful and safe use of radiotherapy procedures. The consistency and accuracy of the applied dosimetry methods pre-define the outcomes of these applications. This paper presents a version of the well-known ferrous sulphate - benzoic acid - xylenol orange (FBX) chemical dosimeter with improved sensitivity, accuracy and precision. Sensitivity is increased due to a slight modification in composition and the preparation procedures. We use stock solutions for the preparation of the dosimeter solution, which consists of 1 mM ferrous sulphate and 16 mM benzoic acid with 0.25 mM xylenol orange added post-irradiation. The nonlinear response to the absorbed dose of this system is eliminated by the increased ferrous sulphate concentration, permitting the calculation of the absorbed dose by a linear relationship between the absorbed dose and the optical absorbance of the solution. The measured chemical yield of our dosimeter is 9.08.10(-6) mol/J for 6 MV photon beams and 6.42.10(-6) mol/J for 250 kVp x-rays. This is a 24% enhancement over the original FBX solution, which permits a finer dose resolution. The accuracy and precision of our method is assured by a well-designed and consistently used practice. A custom designed multipurpose PMMA slab phantom was used for irradiation in reference conditions. This phantom can be used for irradiation in reference conditions of dosimetric solutions, dosimetric films and chemical or biological samples. The combined standard uncertainty of this system is 1.12%, which can be improved by using an appropriate temperature correction factor. Furthermore, a working protocol has been established which allows dosimetry measurements using less than 1 mL dosimetric solutions.	[Polanek, R.; Brunner, Sz; Szabo, E.

A critical appraisal of the circulating levels of differentially expressed microRNA in endometriosis	BIOLOGY OF REPRODUCTION			English	Article						endometriosis; miRNAs; diagnosis; biomarker	MESENCHYMAL STEM-CELLS; INFERTILE WOMEN; BIOMARKERS; SERUM; MIGRATION; CANCER; PROLIFERATION; INVASION; PROFILE; PATHOGENESIS	Endometriosis is a common gynecological condition characterized by estrogen dependence, chronic pelvic pain, infertility, and diagnostic delay of between 5.4 and 12 years. Despite extensive study, no biomarker, either alone or in combination with other markers, has proven superior to laparoscopy for the diagnosis of endometriosis. Recent studies report that circulating levels of differentially expressed microRNA (miRNA) in women with endometriosis compared with controls are potential diagnostic tools. However, the lack of replication and absence of validated differential expression in novel study populations have led some to question the diagnostic value of miRNA. To elucidate potential reasons for the lack of replication of study results and explore future directions to enhance replicability of circulating miRNA results, we carried out an electronic search of the miRNA literature published between 2000 and 2020. Eighteen studies were identified in which 63 different miRNAs were differentially expressed in the circulation of women with endometriosis compared with controls. However, the differential expressions of only 14 miRNAs were duplicated in one or more studies. While individual miRNAs lacked diagnostic value, miRNA panels yielded sensitivity and specificity equal to or better than laparoscopy in five studies. Important differences in study design, sample processing, and analytical methods were identified rendering direct comparisons across studies problematic and could account for the lack of reproducibility of study results. We conclude that while the results of miRNA studies to date are encouraging, refinements to study design and analytical methods should enhance the reliability of circulating miRNA for the diagnosis of endometriosis. Summary sentence miRNA panels in five separate studies were comparable to or better than laparoscopy for the diagnosis of endometriosis; however, important study design and methodological issues account for the lack of replication of results across studies.

Environmental enrichment modulates affiliative and aggressive social behaviour in the neuroligin-3 R451C mouse model of autism spectrum disorder	PHARMACOLOGY BIOCHEMISTRY AND BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Autism spectrum disorder; Neuroligin-3; R451C; Social interaction; Aggression; Environmental enrichment	AGONISTIC BEHAVIOR; YOUNG-CHILDREN; MICE; PHENOTYPES; MUTATIONS; CORTICOSTERONE; ABNORMALITIES; PLASTICITY; DEFEAT; IMPACT	Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterised by impairments in social communication and the presence of restrictive and repetitive behaviours. A mouse model expressing an autism-associated R451C mutation in the gene encoding the synaptic adhesion protein neuroligin-3 (NL3) has been extensively characterised and shows altered behaviour relevant to core traits observed in ASD. Reported impairments in social behaviours in NL3(R451C) mice however remain controversial due to inconsistent findings in various assays across different laboratories. Such inconsistencies could plausibly be explained by an increased susceptibility of the NL3(R451C) mouse social phenotype to environmental modulation. To address this, NL3(R451C) mice were housed in standard or enriched housing from 4 weeks of age prior to behavioural testing. Enrichment rearing enhanced direct interactions with the stranger mouse in all mice in the three-chamber social interaction test however, NL3(R451C) mice did not show impairment in social interaction in the three-chamber test, in contrast with previous reports. Environmental enrichment enhanced aggressive behaviour in all mice, and did not specifically alter the heightened aggressive phenotype previously described in NL3(R451C) mice. Specific genotype effects of enrichment included reduced anxiety-like behaviour in WT mice, and lower locomotor activity levels in NL3 mice. While genotype-specific effects of enrichment were not seen on social behaviour, the general increase in affiliative social interaction and aggression seen in all mice, indicates that these behaviours, are vulnerable to change based on housing condition. Mouse models expressing ASD-associated mutations have great utility in elucidating the neurobiology underling development of core traits and it is crucial that efforts are focussed on those models exhibiting robust phenotypes. In light of the findings in the present study, we suggest approaches to improve replicability and reproducibility in mouse models of ASD.	[Burrows, E. L.; Koyama, L.; May, C.; Hannan, A.

Various methods have been developed to measure telomere length. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based methods remain wide-spread for population-based studies due to the high-throughput capability. While several studies have evaluated the repeatability and reproducibility of different TL measurement methods, the results have been variable. We conducted a literature review of TL measurement cross-method comparison studies that included a PCR-based method published between January 1, 2002 and May 25, 2020. A total of 25 articles were found that matched the inclusion criteria. Papers were reviewed for quality of methodologic reporting of sample and DNA quality, PCR assay characteristics, sample blinding, and analytic approaches to determine final TL. Overall, methodologic reporting was low as assessed by two different reporting guidelines for qPCR-based TL measurement. There was a wide range in the reported correlation between methods (as assessed by Pearson's r) and few studies utilized the recommended intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) for assessment of assay repeatability and methodologic comparisons. The sample size for nearly all studies was less than 100, raising concerns about statistical power. Overall, this review found that the current literature on the relation between TL measurement methods is lacking in validity and scientific rigor. In light of these findings, we present reporting guidelines for PCR-based TL measurement methods and results of analyses of the effect of assay repeatability (ICC) on statistical power of cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. Additional cross-laboratory studies with rigorous methodologic and statistical reporting, adequate sample size, and blinding are essential to accurately determine assay repeatability and replicability as well as the relation between TL measurement methods.

J	Morton, FB; Altschul, D				Morton, F. Blake; Altschul, Drew			Data reduction analyses of animal behaviour: avoiding Kaiser's criterion and adopting more robust automated methods	ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR			English	Article						factor analysis; Kaiser's criterion; parallel analysis; principal components analysis; scree plot	PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS; EXPLORATORY FACTOR-ANALYSIS; RELATIONSHIP QUALITY; COGNITIVE-ABILITY; NUMBER; HABITUATION; STABILITY; SUCCESS; RISK; SIZE	Data reduction analyses such as principal components and exploratory factor analyses identify relationships within a set of potentially correlated variables, and cluster correlated variables into a smaller overall quantity of groupings. Because of their relative objectivity, these analyses are popular throughout the animal literature to study a wide variety of topics. Numerous authors have highlighted 'best practice' guidelines for component/factor 'extraction', i.e. determining how many components/factors to extract from a data reduction analysis, because this can greatly impact the interpretation, comparability and replicability of one's results. Statisticians agree that Kaiser's criterion, i.e. extracting components/factors with eigenvectors >1.0, should never be used, yet, within the animal literature, a considerable number of authors still use it, even as recently as 2018 and across a wide range of taxa (e.g. insects, birds, fish, mammals) and topics (e.g. personality, cognition, health, morphology, reproduction). It is therefore clear that further awareness is needed to target the animal sciences to ensure that results optimize structural stability and, thus, comparability and reproducibility. In this commentary, we first clarify the distinction between principal components and exploratory factor analyses in terms of analysing simple versus complex structures, and how this relates to component/factor extraction. Second, we highlight empirical evidence from simulation studies to explain why certain extraction methods are more reliable than others, including why automated methods are better, and why Kaiser's criterion is inappropriate and should therefore never be used. Third, we provide recommendations on what to do if multiple automated extraction methods 'disagree' which can arise when dealing with complex structures. Finally, we explain how to perform and interpret more robust and automated extraction tests using R. (C) 2019 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

This knowledge has the potential to inform mathematics education. Unfortunately, numerical cognition research and mathematics education remain disconnected from one another, lacking the proper infrastructure to allow for productive and meaningful exchange between disciplines. The present study was designed to address this gap. Aim This study reports on the design, implementation, and effects of a 16-week (25-hour) mathematics Professional Development (PD) model for Kindergarten to Grade 3 educators and their students. A central goal of the PD was to better integrate numerical cognition research and mathematics education. Sample A total of 45 K-3 educators and 180 of their students participated. Methods To test the reproducibility and replicability of the model, the study was carried out across two different sites, over a two-year period, and involved a combination of two different study designs: a quasi-experimental pre-post-research design and a within-group crossover intervention design. Result The results of the first implementation (Year 1), indicated that compared to a control group, both teachers and students benefited from the intervention. Teachers demonstrated gains on a both self-report measure and test of numerical cognition knowledge, while students demonstrated gains in number line estimation, arithmetic, and numeration. In Year 2, teachers in the intervention group demonstrated greater improvements than the control group on the self-report measure, but not the test, of numerical cognition knowledge. At the student level, there was some evidence of gains in numeration. Conclusion Given the mixed findings, questions remain as to why the model may be effective in one school context but not another.

J	Crous, F				Crous, Frederik (Freddie)			Indeterminateness in industrial and organisational psychological research: A root metaphor analysis	SA JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						precision/imprecision; world hypothesis; cognitive pathway; root metaphor; formism; replication crisis; industrial and organisational (I/O) psychology	ENTREPRENEURSHIP	Problematisation: Efendic and Van Zyl (2019) attribute the so-called replication crisis in psychological research and industrial and organisational (I/O) psychological research in particular to a series of systemic issues. Be that as it may, their opinion does not consider the worldview/world hypothesis/world theory/paradigm with its distinct, underlying logic/cognitive pathway and root metaphor in which the replication crisis is embedded. Implications: By considering the worldview in which they operate, researchers and practitioners may come to understand the basis of the reproducibility and replicability challenge in psychological research. By ignoring it, those researchers and practitioners may become increasingly frustrated with their research efforts. By understanding it, they should appreciate and value Efendic and Van Zyl's (2019) recommended strategies. Purpose: The purpose of this rebuttal in the form of an opinion paper is not to provide an opposing argument or dispute but rather to offer an extension to, or refinement of, these authors' opinion. This effort is initiated by the following question: what is the problem of indeterminateness (suggested by the replication crisis), which is endemic to the dominant I/O psychological research paradigm? By going beyond the systemic issues identified by Efendic and Van Zyl, this problem is addressed on a worldview level. Recommendation: In view of the evidence provided, it is concluded that - contrary to belief - psychologists employ a formistic, rather than a mechanistic, root metaphor or logic. As imprecision is an inherent weakness of formism, psychologists who research and practise from this worldview have no choice but to adhere to the recommendations or strategies proposed by Efendic and Van Zyl. In doing so, however, they will not be able to completely do away with the problem of indeterminateness in I/O psychology, but these authors' recommended strategies will provide them with the means for dealing with this weakness inherent in their research paradigm in a responsible manner.

Many Labs 5: Testing Pre-Data-Collection Peer Review as an Intervention to Increase Replicability	ADVANCES IN METHODS AND PRACTICES IN PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCE			English	Article						replication; reproducibility; metascience; peer review; Registered Reports; open data; preregistered	ET-AL. 2008; REGISTERED REPLICATION; REPRODUCIBILITY; CONSEQUENCES; CRISIS; MODEL	Replication studies in psychological science sometimes fail to reproduce prior findings. If these studies use methods that are unfaithful to the original study or ineffective in eliciting the phenomenon of interest, then a failure to replicate may be a failure of the protocol rather than a challenge to the original finding. Formal pre-data-collection peer review by experts may address shortcomings and increase replicability rates. We selected 10 replication studies from the Reproducibility Project: Psychology (RP:P; Open Science Collaboration, 2015) for which the original authors had expressed concerns about the replication designs before data collection; only one of these studies had yielded a statistically significant effect (p < .05). Commenters suggested that lack of adherence to expert review and low-powered tests were the reasons that most of these RP:P studies failed to replicate the original effects. We revised the replication protocols and received formal peer review prior to conducting new replication studies. We administered the RP:P and revised protocols in multiple laboratories (median number of laboratories per original study = 6.5, range = 3-9; median total sample = 1,279.5, range = 276-3,512) for high-powered tests of each original finding with both protocols. Overall, following the preregistered analysis plan, we found that the revised protocols produced effect sizes similar to those of the RP:P protocols (Delta r = .002 or .014, depending on analytic approach). The median effect size for the revised protocols (r = .05) was similar to that of the RP:P protocols (r = .04) and the original RP:P replications (r = .11), and smaller than that of the original studies (r = .37). Analysis of the cumulative evidence across the original studies and the corresponding three replication attempts provided very precise estimates of the 10 tested effects and indicated that their effect sizes (median r = .07, range = .00-.15) were 78% smaller, on average, than the original effect sizes (median r = .37, range = .19-.50).

J	Frachtenberg, E				Frachtenberg, Eitan			Research artifacts and citations in computer systems papers	PEERJ COMPUTER SCIENCE			English	Article						Reproducible research; Computer systems; Software artifacts; Bibliometrics; Open access; Software repositories; FAIR	OPEN ACCESS; GOOGLE SCHOLAR; IMPACT; WEB; REPRODUCIBILITY; REPEATABILITY; CONFERENCES; ADVANTAGE; PATTERNS; SCIENCE	Research in computer systems often involves the engineering, implementation, and measurement of complex systems software and data. The availability of these artifacts is critical to the reproducibility and replicability of the research results, because system software often embodies numerous implicit assumptions and parameters that are not fully documented in the research article itself. Artifact availability has also been previously associated with higher paper impact, as measured by citations counts. And yet, the sharing of research artifacts is still not as common as warranted by its importance. The primary goal of this study is to provide an exploratory statistical analysis of the artifact-sharing rates and associated factors in the research field of computer systems. To this end, we explore a cross-sectional dataset of papers from 56 contemporaneous systems conferences. In addition to extensive data on the conferences, papers, and authors, this analyze dataset includes data on the release, ongoing availability, badging, and locations of research artifacts. We combine this manually curated dataset with citation counts to evaluate the relationships between different artifact properties and citation metrics. Additionally, we revisit previous observations from other fields on the relationships between artifact properties and various other characteristics of papers, authors, and venue and apply them to this field. The overall rate of artifact sharing we find in this dataset is approximately 30%, although it varies significantly with paper, author, and conference factors, and it is closer to 43% for conferences that actively evaluated artifact sharing. Approximately 20% of all shared artifacts are no longer accessible four years after publications, predominately when hosted on personal and academic websites. Our main finding is that papers with shared artifacts averaged approximately 75% more citations than papers with none. Even after controlling for numerous confounding covariates, the release of an artifact appears to increase the citations of a systems paper by some 34%. This metric is further boosted by the open availability of the paper's text.

EU AIMS LEAP Grp Authorship	Resting state EEG power spectrum and functional connectivity in autism: a cross-sectional analysis	MOLECULAR AUTISM			English	Article						Autism spectrum disorder; EEG; Resting state; Power spectrum; Functional connectivity	CHILDREN; PATTERNS; LOCALIZATION; VALIDATION; BIOMARKERS; CHILDHOOD; DISORDER	Background Understanding the development of the neuronal circuitry underlying autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is critical to shed light into its etiology and for the development of treatment options. Resting state EEG provides a window into spontaneous local and long-range neuronal synchronization and has been investigated in many ASD studies, but results are inconsistent. Unbiased investigation in large and comprehensive samples focusing on replicability is needed. Methods We quantified resting state EEG alpha peak metrics, power spectrum (PS, 2-32 Hz) and functional connectivity (FC) in 411 children, adolescents and adults (n = 212 ASD, n = 199 neurotypicals [NT], all with IQ > 75). We performed analyses in source-space using individual head models derived from the participants' MRIs. We tested for differences in mean and variance between the ASD and NT groups for both PS and FC using linear mixed effects models accounting for age, sex, IQ and site effects. Then, we used machine learning to assess whether a multivariate combination of EEG features could better separate ASD and NT participants. All analyses were embedded within a train-validation approach (70%-30% split). Results In the training dataset, we found an interaction between age and group for the reactivity to eye opening (p = .042 uncorrected), and a significant but weak multivariate ASD vs. NT classification performance for PS and FC (sensitivity 0.52-0.62, specificity 0.59-0.73). None of these findings replicated significantly in the validation dataset, although the effect size in the validation dataset overlapped with the prediction interval from the training dataset. Limitations The statistical power to detect weak effects-of the magnitude of those found in the training dataset-in the validation dataset is small, and we cannot fully conclude on the reproducibility of the training dataset's effects. Conclusions This suggests that PS and FC values in ASD and NT have a strong overlap, and that differences between both groups (in both mean and variance) have, at best, a small effect size. Larger studies would be needed to investigate and replicate such potential effects.

Compressive Big Data Analytics: An ensemble meta-algorithm for high-dimensional multisource datasets	PLOS ONE			English	Article							RULES; THUMB	Health advances are contingent on continuous development of new methods and approaches to foster data-driven discovery in the biomedical and clinical sciences. Open-science and team-based scientific discovery offer hope for tackling some of the difficult challenges associated with managing, modeling, and interpreting of large, complex, and multisource data. Translating raw observations into useful information and actionable knowledge depends on effective domain-independent reproducibility, area-specific replicability, data curation, analysis protocols, organization, management and sharing of health-related digital objects. This study expands the functionality and utility of an ensemble semi-supervised machine learning technique called Compressive Big Data Analytics (CBDA). Applied to high-dimensional data, CBDA (1) identifies salient features and key biomarkers enabling reliable and reproducible forecasting of binary, multinomial and continuous outcomes (i.e., feature mining); and (2) suggests the most accurate algorithms/models for predictive analytics of the observed data (i.e., model mining). The method relies on iterative subsampling, combines function optimization and statistical inference, and generates ensemble predictions for observed univariate outcomes. The novelty of this study is highlighted by a new and expanded set of CBDA features including (1) efficiently handling extremely large datasets (>100,000 cases and >1,000 features); (2) generalizing the internal and external validation steps; (3) expanding the set of base-learners for joint ensemble prediction; (4) introducing an automated selection of CBDA specifications; and (5) providing mechanisms to assess CBDA convergence, evaluate the prediction accuracy, and measure result consistency. To ground the mathematical model and the corresponding computational algorithm, CBDA 2.0 validation utilizes synthetic datasets as well as a population-wide census-like study. Specifically, an empirical validation of the CBDA technique is based on a translational health research using a large-scale clinical study (UK Biobank), which includes imaging, cognitive, and clinical assessment data. The UK Biobank archive presents several difficult challenges related to the aggregation, harmonization, modeling, and interrogation of the information. These problems are related to the complex longitudinal structure, variable heterogeneity, feature multicollinearity, incongruency, and missingness, as well as violations of classical parametric assumptions. Our results show the scalability, efficiency, and usability of CBDA to interrogate complex data into structural information leading to derived knowledge and translational action. Applying CBDA 2.0 to the UK Biobank case-study allows predicting various outcomes of interest, e.g., mood disorders and irritability, and suggests new and exciting avenues of evidence-based research in the context of identifying, tracking, and treating mental health and aging-related diseases. Following open-science principles, we share the entire end-to-end protocol, source-code, and results. This facilitates independent validation, result reproducibility, and team-based collaborative discovery.

J	Mucha, T; Seppala, T				Mucha, Tomasz; Seppala, Timo			Estimating firm digitalization: A method for disaggregating sector-level digital intensity to firm-level	METHODSX			English	Article						Digital transformation; Digital taxonomy; IT intensity; Data disaggregation	GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAINS	The digital transformation of firms plays an increasingly important role in the economy and society. However, limited access to data on firm-level digital intensity is an impediment to advancement of multiple research projects concerned with firm digitalization. To alleviate this challenge, this paper proposes a method for estimating firm-level digital intensity based on other more readily available firm-level data and reference data on digitalization, which is available on sector-level. The proposed method utilizes firm-level revenue breakdown by sector to estimate sector revenue-weighted digital intensity scores, which lead to classification of firms into low, medium and high digital intensity groups. The output from the proposed method can be directly used in research concerned with firm digitalization and investigating this multifaceted phenomenon. Results from the application of the proposed method to an illustrative sample of large US and non-US firms (20 0 0 observations in total) indicate that firm-level digital intensity can be efficiently estimated for large samples using data commonly available to researchers. The key differences between the proposed method and alternative methods are: center dot Recognition of the fact that firms might participate in more than one sector or industry, which partially explains within-sector heterogeneity in firm-level digital intensity. We found that 67.8% of large US firms and 78.6% of large non-US firms were engaged in more than one industry. center dot Use of reference sector-level digital intensity scores, which allows for rapid update, application across geographies and time, as well as parallel calculation of multiple digital intensity scores for each reference data. Furthermore, use of reference data enables supplementation of firm-level data on digitalization. center dot Replicability of the method and reproducibility of the results through inclusion of the source code and availability of data through research and commercial databases.

Towards greater transparency in neurodevelopmental disorders research: use of a proposed workflow and propensity scores to facilitate selection of matched groups	JOURNAL OF NEURODEVELOPMENTAL DISORDERS			English	Article						Matching; Transparency; Group comparison; Reproducibility; Propensity score; Covariate	METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES; CHILDREN; AUTISM; SMOKING; DISABILITIES; SPECIFICITY; VARIABLES	Background Matching is one commonly utilized method in quasi-experimental designs involving individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD). This method ensures two or more groups (e.g., individuals with an NDD versus neurotypical individuals) are balanced on pre-existing covariates (e.g., IQ), enabling researchers to interpret performance on outcome measures as being attributed to group membership. While much attention has been paid to the statistical criteria of how to assess whether groups are well-matched, relatively little attention has been given to a crucial prior step: the selection of the individuals that are included in matched groups. The selection of individuals is often an undocumented process, which can invite unintentional, arbitrary, and biased decision-making. Limited documentation can result in findings that have limited reproducibility and replicability and thereby have poor potential for generalization to the broader population. Especially given the heterogeneity of individuals with NDDs, interpretation of research findings depends on minimizing bias at all stages of data collection and analysis. Results In the spirit of open science, this tutorial demonstrates how a workflow can be used to provide a transparent, reproducible, and replicable process to select individuals for matched groups. Our workflow includes the following key steps: Assess data, Select covariates, Conduct matching, and Diagnose matching. Our sample dataset is from children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD;n= 25) and typically developing children (n= 43) but can be adapted to comparisons of any two groups in quasi-experimental designs. We work through this method to conduct and document matching using propensity scores implemented with the R package MatchIt. Data and code are publicly available, and a template for this workflow is provided in the Additional file1as well as on a public repository. Conclusions It is important to provide clear documentation regarding the selection process to establish matched groups. This documentation ensures better transparency in participant selection and data analysis in NDD research. We hope the adoption of such a workflow will ultimately advance our ability to replicate findings and help improve the lives of individuals with NDDs.

Efforts to identify plant derived molecules with anti-HIV properties require reproducible assay systems for routine screening of selected plant compounds. Although a number of standardized HIV-1 pseudoviruses have been generated to assess infectivity, replicability or reproducibility, HIV-1 subtype C (HIV-1-C) pseudoviruses have not been comprehensively characterized to identify inhibitory plant substances. Aim of the study: The current study aimed at developing an HIV-1-C pseudovirus assay, and evaluate plant substances targeting reverse transcriptase (RT) activity. Materials and methods: HIV-1 subtype C pseudoviruses containing a luciferase reporter gene were generated by transfection of human 293T cells. HIV-1 subtype B (HIV-1-B) wild type pseudoviruses and mutants resistant to nucleoside and non-nucleoside RT inhibitors were also generated and used as controls. Selected plant substances and the RT inhibitors Zidovudine (AZT) and Nevirapine (NVP), were used to evaluate inhibition. Pseudovirus infectivity was determined by luciferase measurement in CF2/CD4(+)/CCR5 cells, and cytotoxicity was determined using the MTT assay. AZT and NVP inhibited wild type pseudoviruses in a dose dependent manner, with IC50 values in the nanomolar range. Results: Pseudoviruses harbouring RT drug resistance mutations were poorly suppressed by AZT and NVP. Catechin, obtained from Peltophorum africanum inhibited HIV-1-C and HIV-1-B pseudoviruses with selective indices of 6304 mu M (IC50: 0.49 mu M, CC50: 3089 mu M) and 1343 mu M (IC50: 2.3 mu M, CC50: 3089 mu M), respectively; while the methanol root crude extract of Elaeodendron transvaalense gave IC50 values of 11.11 mu g/ml and 16.86 mu g/ml, respectively. Conclusion: The developed HIV-1-C pseudovirus assay can be used to screen plant substances for RT inhibition, and may have utility in settings with limited access to high level biosafety facilities.

In Vivo Plasticity at Hippocampal Schaffer Collateral-CA1 Synapses: Replicability of the LTP Response and Pharmacology in the Long-Evans Rat	NEURAL PLASTICITY			English	Article							PAIRED-PULSE FACILITATION; TERM POTENTIATION; SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY; CA1 REGION; AREA CA1; PHOSPHODIESTERASE INHIBITORS; CHOLINERGIC MODULATION; STIMULATION PROTOCOLS; MULTIPLE FORMS; SPATIAL MEMORY	Broad issues associated with non-replicability have been described in experimental pharmacological and behavioral cognitive studies. Efforts to prevent biases that contribute to non-replicable scientific protocols and to improve experimental rigor for reproducibility are increasingly seen as a basic requirement for the integrity of scientific research. Synaptic plasticity, encompassing long-term potentiation (LTP), is believed to underlie mechanisms of learning and memory. The present study was undertaken in Long-Evans (LE) rats, a strain of rat commonly used in cognitive behavioral tests, to (1) compare three LTP tetanisation protocols, namely, the high-frequency stimulation (HFS), the theta-burst stimulation (TBS), and the paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) at the Schaffer collateral-CA1 stratum radiatum synapse and to (2) assess sensitivity to acute pharmacology. Results: (1) When compared to Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats, the HFS using a stimulus intensity of 50% of the maximum slope obtained from input/output (I/O) curves elicited lower and higher thresholds of synaptic plasticity responses in SD and LE rats, respectively. The 2-train TBS protocol significantly enhanced the LTP response in LE rats over the 5- and 10-train TBS protocols in both strains, and the 5xTBS protocol inducing a subthreshold LTP response was used in subsequent pharmacological studies in LE rats. The PPF protocol, investigating the locus of the LTP response, showed no difference for the selected interstimulus intervals. (2) Scopolamine, a nonspecific muscarinic antagonist, had a subtle effect, whereas donepezil, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, significantly enhanced the LTP response, demonstrating the sensitivity of the TBS protocol to enhanced cholinergic tone. MK-801, a noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist, significantly reduced LTP response, while memantine, another NMDA antagonist, had no effect on LTP response, likely associated with a weaker TBS protocol. PQ10, a phosphodiesterase-10 inhibitor, significantly enhanced the TBS-induced LTP response, but did not change the PPF response. Overall, the results confirm the strain-dependent differences in the form of synaptic plasticity, replicate earlier plasticity results, and report effective protocols that generate a relatively subthreshold margin of LTP induction and maintenance, which are suitable for pharmacology in the LE rat strain mainly used in cognitive studies.

The California mouse (Peromyscus californicus) has unique traits that make it an ideal model for studying biological mechanisms underlying human-relevant behaviors such as intra-female aggression, biparental care, and monogamy. Indeed, peer-reviewed scientific publications using California mouse as a model for behavioral research have more than doubled in the past decade. Critically, behavioral outcomes in captive animals can be profoundly affected by housing conditions, but there is very limited knowledge regarding species-specific housing needs in California mice. Currently, California mouse investigators have to rely on guidelines aimed for more common laboratory species that show vastly different physiology, behavior, and/or ecological niche. This not only could be suboptimal for animals' welfare, but also result in lack of standardization that could potentially compromise experimental reproducibility and replicability across laboratories. With the aim of assessing how different housing systems can affect California mouse behavior both in the home cage as well as the open field and social interaction tests before and after social defeat stress, here we tested three different caging systems: 1. Standard mouse cage, 2. Large cage, and 3. Large cage + environmental enrichment (EE), which focused on increasing vertical complexity based on observations that California mice are semiarboreal in the wild. We found that the effects of housing were largely sex specific: compared to standard cages, in females large + EE reduced home cage stereotypic-like backflipping and rearing behaviors, while large cage increased social interactions. In males, the large + EE cage reduced rearing and digging but did not significantly affect backflipping behavior. Interestingly, while there were no significant differences in the open field and social interaction pre-stress behaviors, large and large + EE housing increased the sensitivity of these tests to detect stress induced phenotypes in females. Together, these results suggest that increasing social and environmental complexity affects home cage behaviors in male and female California mice without interfering with, but rather increasing the magnitude of, the effects of defeat stress on the open field and social interaction tests.

Most research into such assessment is sited in a statistical paradigm that focuses on psychometric properties or replicability of such tests. Equally important, but less researched, is the question of how far consultations with simulated patients reflect real clinical encounters - for which sociolinguistics, defined as the study of language in its socio-cultural context, provides a helpful analytic lens. Discussion: In this debate article, we draw on a detailed empirical study of assessed role-plays, involving sociolinguistic analysis of talk in OSCE interactions. We consider critically the evidence for the simulated consultation (a) as a proxy for the real; (b) as performance; (c) as a context for assessing talk; and (d) as potentially disadvantaging candidates trained overseas. Talk is always a performance in context, especially in professional situations (such as the consultation) and institutional ones (the assessment of professional skills and competence). Candidates who can handle the social and linguistic complexities of the artificial context of assessed role-plays score highly - yet what is being assessed is not real professional communication, but the ability to voice a credible appearance of such communication. Summary: Fidelity may not be the primary objective of simulation for medical training, where it enables the practising of skills. However the linguistic problems and differences that arise from interacting in artificial settings are of considerable importance in assessment, where we must be sure that the exam construct adequately embodies the skills expected for real-life practice. The reproducibility of assessed simulations should not be confused with their validity. Sociolinguistic analysis of simulations in various professional contexts has identified evidence for the gap between real interactions and assessed role-plays. The contextual conditions of the simulated consultation both expect and reward a particular interactional style. Whilst simulation undoubtedly has a place in formative learning for professional communication, the simulated consultation may distort assessment of professional communication These sociolinguistic findings contribute to the on-going critique of simulations in high-stakes assessments and indicate that further research, which steps outside psychometric approaches, is necessary.

Research has been stimulated by the relatively recent discovery that urine is not sterile; urinary tract microbes have been linked to health problems, including urinary infections, incontinence, and cancer. Replicability is a well-established challenge in microbiome research with a variety of contributing factors at all stages, from sample collection to code execution. Here, we focus on voided urine sample storage conditions for urogenital microbiome analysis. Using urine samples collected from 10 adult females, we investigated the microbiome preservation efficacy of AssayAssure Genelock (Genelock), compared with no preservative, under different temperature conditions. We varied temperature over 48 h in order to examine the impact of conditions samples may experience with home voided urine collection and shipping to a central biorepository. The following common lab and shipping conditions were investigated: -20 degrees C, ambient temperature, 4 degrees C, freeze-thaw cycle, and heat cycle. At 48 h, all samples were stored at -80 degrees C until processing. After generating 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing data using the highly sensitive KatharoSeq protocol, we observed individual variation in both alpha and beta diversity metrics below interhuman differences, corroborating reports of individual microbiome variability in other specimen types. While there was no significant difference in beta diversity when comparing Genelock versus no preservative, we did observe a higher concordance with Genelock samples shipped at colder temperatures (-20 degrees C and 4 degrees C) when compared with the samples shipped at -20 degrees C without preservative. Our results indicate that Genelock does not introduce a significant amount of microbial bias when used on a range of temperatures and is most effective at colder temperatures.IMPORTANCE The urogenital microbiome is an understudied yet important human microbiome niche. Research has been stimulated by the relatively recent discovery that urine is not sterile; urinary tract microbes have been linked to health problems, including urinary infections, incontinence, and cancer. The quality of life and economic impact of UTIs and urgency incontinence alone are enormous, with $3.5 billion and $82.6 billion, respectively, spent in the United States. annually. Given the low biomass of urine, novelty of the field, and limited reproducibility evidence, it is critical to study urine sample storage conditions to optimize scientific rigor. Efficient and reliable preservation methods inform methods for home self-sample collection and shipping, increasing the potential use in larger-scale studies. Here, we examined both buffer and temperature variation effects on 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing results from urogenital samples, providing data on the consequences of common storage methods on urogenital microbiome results.

J	Lynch, CJ; Gore, R				Lynch, Christopher J.; Gore, Ross			Application of one-, three-, and seven-day forecasts during early onset on the COVID-19 epidemic dataset using moving average, autoregressive, autoregressive moving average, autoregressive integrated moving average, and naive forecasting methods	DATA IN BRIEF			English	Article; Data Paper						Coronavirus COVID-19; Infectious diseases; Epidemic modeling; ARIMA(p, d, q) model; ARMA model; Holt-winters exponential smoothing model; Statistical analysis; Short-range time series forecasting	TIME-SERIES	The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) spread rapidly across the world since its appearance in December 2019. This data set creates one-, three-, and seven-day forecasts of the COVID-19 pandemic's cumulative case counts at the county, health district, and state geographic levels for the state of Virginia. Forecasts are created over the first 46 days of reported COVID-19 cases using the cumulative case count data provided by The New York Times as of April 22, 2020. From this historical data, one-, three-, seven, and all-days prior to the forecast start date are used to generate the forecasts. Forecasts are created using: (1) a Naive approach; (2) Holt-Winters exponential smoothing (HW); (3) growth rate (Growth); (4) moving average (MA); (5) autoregressive (AR); (6) autoregressive moving average (ARMA); and (7) autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA). Median Absolute Error (MdAE) and Median Absolute Percentage Error (MdAPE) metrics are created with each forecast to evaluate the forecast with respect to existing historical data. These error metrics are aggregated to provide a means for assessing which combination of forecast method, forecast length, and lookback length are best fits, based on lowest aggregated error at each geographic level. The data set is comprised of an R-Project file, four R source code files, all 1,329,404 generated short-range forecasts, MdAE and MdAPE error metric data for each forecast, copies of the input files, and the generated comparison tables. All code and data files are provided to provide transparency and facilitate replicability and reproducibility. This package opens directly in RStudio through the R Project file. The R Project file removes the need to set path locations for the folders contained within the data set to simplify setup requirements. This data set provides two avenues for reproducing results: 1) Use the provided code to generate the forecasts from scratch and then run the analyses; or 2) Load the saved forecast data and run the analyses on the stored data. Code annotations provide the instructions needed to accomplish both routes. This data can be used to generate the same set of forecasts and error metrics for any US state by altering the state parameter within the source code. Users can also generate health district forecasts for any other state, by providing a file which maps each county within a state to its respective health-district. The source code can be connected to the most up-to-date version of The New York Times COVID-19 dataset allows for the generation of forecasts up to the most recently reported data to facilitate near real-time forecasting.

On methods, tools and aims of computational literary studies	DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY			English	Article							STYLOMETRY	This paper is a case-driven contribution to the discussion on the method-theory relationship in practices within the field of Computational Literary Studies (CLS). Progress in this field dedicated to the computational analysis of literary texts has long revolved around the new, digital tools: tools, as computational devices for analysis, have had here a comparatively strong status as research entities of their own, while their ontological status has remained unclear to the day. As a rule, they have widely been imported from the fields of data science and NLP, while less often being hand tailored to specific tasks within interdisciplinary settings. Although studies within CLS are evolving to both a higher degree of specialization in method (going beyond the limitations of out-of-the-box tools) and a stronger theoretical modeling, the technological dimension remains a defining factor. An unreflective adoption of technology in the shape of tools can compromise the plausibility and the reproducibility of the results produced using these tools. Our paper presents a multi-faceted intervention to the discussion around tools, methods, and the research questions that are answered with them. It presents research perspectives first conceivedat the ADHO SIG-DLS workshop Anatomy of tools: A closer look at textual DH methodologies that took place in Utrecht in July 2019. At that event, the authors discussed selected case studies to address tool criticism from several angles. Our goal was to leverage a tool-critical perspective, in order to "take stock, reflect upon and critically comment upon our own practices" within CLS. We identified Textometrie, Stylometry, and Semantic Text Mining as three central types of hands on CLS. For each of these sub-fields, we asked: What are our tools and methods-in-use? What are the implications of using a tool-oriented perspective as opposed to a methodology-oriented one? How do either relate to research questions and theory? These questions were explored by case-studies on an exemplary basis. The unifying perspective of this paper is an applied tool criticism - a critical inquiry leveraged towards crucial dimensions of CLS practices. Here we re-compose the original oral papers and add entirely new sections to it, to create a useful overview of the issue through a combination of perspectives. While we elaborated the thematic connections between the individual case studies, we hope the interactive spirit of an exemplary exchange remains palpable: individual research perspectives shape the case studies reported for Textometrie, Stylometry and Semantic TextMining, are complemented by further studies showcasing CLS-specific perspectives on replicability and domain-specific research, and a short section discussing a tool inventory as a practical, community-based incarnation of tool criticism. The article reflects thus a rich array of perspectives on tool criticism, including the complementary perspective of tool defense - arguing that we need tools and methods as a basic common ground on how to carry out fundamental operations of analysis and interpretation within a community.

In most cases, researchers must deal with the sparse recordings composing Small, Unbalanced, Noisy, but Genuine (SUNG) datasets. SUNG datasets are characterized by a limited number of recordings, most often noisy, and unbalanced in number between the individuals or categories of vocalizations. SUNG datasets therefore offer a valuable but inevitably distorted vision of communication systems. Adopting the best practices in their analysis is essential to effectively extract the available information and draw reliable conclusions. Here we show that the most recent advances in machine learning applied to a SUNG dataset succeed in unraveling the complex vocal repertoire of the bonobo, and we propose a workflow that can be effective with other animal species. We implement acoustic parameterization in three feature spaces and run a Supervised Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (S-UMAP) to evaluate how call types and individual signatures cluster in the bonobo acoustic space. We then implement three classification algorithms (Support Vector Machine, xgboost, neural networks) and their combination to explore the structure and variability of bonobo calls, as well as the robustness of the individual signature they encode. We underscore how classification performance is affected by the feature set and identify the most informative features. In addition, we highlight the need to address data leakage in the evaluation of classification performance to avoid misleading interpretations. Our results lead to identifying several practical approaches that are generalizable to any other animal communication system. To improve the reliability and replicability of vocal communication studies with SUNG datasets, we thus recommend: i) comparing several acoustic parameterizations; ii) visualizing the dataset with supervised UMAP to examine the species acoustic space; iii) adopting Support Vector Machines as the baseline classification approach; iv) explicitly evaluating data leakage and possibly implementing a mitigation strategy. Author summaryDeciphering animal vocal communication is a great challenge in most species. Audio recordings of vocal interactions help to understand what animals are saying to whom and when, but scientists are often faced with data collections characterized by a limited number of recordings, mostly noisy, and unbalanced in numbers between individuals or vocalization categories. Such datasets are far from perfect, but they are our best chance to understand communication in hard-to-record species. Opportunities may especially be limited to record endangered species such as our closest relatives, bonobos and chimpanzees. We propose an efficient workflow to analyze such imperfect datasets using recent methods developed in machine learning. We detail how this approach works and its performance in unraveling the complex vocal repertoire of the bonobo. Our results lead to the identification of several practical approaches that are generalizable to other animal communication systems. Finally, we make methodological recommendations to improve the reliability and reproducibility of vocal communication studies with these imperfect datasets that we call SUNG (Small, Unbalanced, Noisy, but Genuine datasets).

J	Shmeleva, NV				Shmeleva, Natalia, V			ABOUT CRITERIA OF MODERN ART: CULTURAL APPROACH	VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-KULTUROLOGIYA I ISKUSSTVOVEDENIE-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF CULTURAL STUDIES AND ART HISTORY			Russian	Article						work of art; cultural text; criteria of art; feel; recipient; visual practices		XX century introduced significant adjustments in the understanding of art. Art lost its special "aura" (V. Benjamin) with the development of visual practices, the growing role of science and the recipient in the design of artistic reality, which led to a change in the notion of the criteria of art up to the denial of its existence. The scientific novelty is determined by the change in the status of art in modern culture. The changes that took place in the art of the 19th century expanded the range of artistic value by recognizing new values and involving the figure of the recipient in the process of creating art. The acceleration of the development of culture in the 20th century led to a further change in the perception of art, which began to rely more on a rethinking of a tradition that had been enriched by the discovery of previously little-known cultures. In this regard, the criteria of art, representing the artwork as a cultural text aimed at understanding the experience of previous cultural eras, are changed. Purpose of the study describe the changes in the role of art in human life, which were reflected primarily in the rethinking of art criteria. In the twentieth century, there is a large number of contradictory phenomena called to be called culture and going beyond the framework of art, which requires their mastering. Visual mass culture, which does not have the signs of a new one, has trained the viewer to pay attention to the already realized reality, presented in a new shell from a different angle. Herewith the recipient ascribes traditional values and meanings to the mastered reality. Thus, the replicability and reproducibility of works of art change the person's idea of the subject of art. Methods: The analysis of art, through the lens of its criteria, took a cultural approach, which allowed to consider art in the context of the cultural text. To represent the specificities of contemporary art, descriptive and comparative methods were used to fit contemporary art into the cultural context and to identify its main criteria. The concepts of "art" and "culture" become largely synonymous in the consciousness of modern man. Peculiarities of the perception of a work of art are associated with the fusion of the concepts "work of art" and "cultural text", when culture began to substitute for itself art, so people in the assessments of art are guided by the same concepts that apply to culture. Recognition of the conscious, as the main criterion of the art of mass consciousness, translates the work of art into the rank of a cultural text, for which other values and aesthetic criteria already act. We can draw a conclusion on the basis of the perception of the cultural text, that the toolkit for evaluating the cultural text passes to art, and therefore the main criteria are not the aesthetic, but the anthropological, associated with the creative activity of the recipient and his participation in the creation of a work of art.
